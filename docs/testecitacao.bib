The majority of patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) or VL develop a long-term protective immunity after cure from infection, which indicates that development of an effective vaccine against leishmaniasis is possible. Such protection may also be achieved by immunization with live attenuated parasites that do not cause disease. We have previously reported a protective response in mice, hamsters and dogs with Leishmania donovani centrin gene knock-out parasites (LdCen-/-), a live attenuated parasite with a cell division specific centrin1 gene deletion. In this study we have explored the effects of salivary protein LJM19 as an adjuvant and intradermal (ID) route of immunization on the efficacy of LdCen-/- parasites as a vaccine against virulent L. donovani.},

	abstract = {Background:  Zoonotic visceral leishmaniasis by Leishmania infantum is a first-order pathology in canine veterinary clinics in endemic areas. Moreover, canine infections are considered the main reservoir for human disease; despite their importance in the control of the disease within a One Health approach, no scientometric study has been published. Aims of the study included analyzing the impact of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) on the scientific literature, drugs or combinations used, trends in the period from 2000 to 2020 and efficacy criteria employed.
Methods:  A Web of Science (WOS)-based analysis of publications on CanL and chemotherapy of the disease in the period 2000–2020 was carried out using a stepwise methodology. Data were analyzed by year, geographical origin, chemical groups, drugs and combinations, and efficacy criteria.
Results:  Reports on CanL (n = 3324) represented {\textless} 16\% of all publications on leishmaniasis (n = 20,968), and of these around 18\% (n = 596) were related to chemotherapy. Publication records on CanL followed the distribution of the infection by L. infantum in endemic areas although Mediterranean countries were overrepresented in the reports on chemotherapy of CanL. Publications on the main antileishmanial drugs used in clinical practice showed a sus‑tained tendency in the period analyzed. Pentavalent antimonials ­(SbV), alone or in combination with allopurinol, rep‑resented {\textgreater} 50\% of all publications on chemotherapy of CanL despite the availability of more recently marketed drugs.
Conclusions:  Chemotherapy of CanL still relies on ­SbV and combinations and to a lesser extent on miltefosine (MIL). Reports on chemotherapy are scarce and mostly publicly funded, and the variability of experimental conditions hampers the direct comparison of the efficacy of drugs, combinations and schedules. The vast majority of reports on efficacy do not include any information on supportive therapy; this reduces the actual value of the studies if intended for the practical management of the disease. Complete reports on the chemotherapy (etiological + symptomatic) would add value to the trials performed.},

	abstract = {Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is an important zoonosis in Brazil. Dogs are considered the main domestic reservoirs of the disease in the country; hence, control measures are focused on these reservoirs. Despite efforts to prevent and control VL, important reductions in disease prevalence and incidence have not been identified, stimulating the development and application of new strategies. The choice and implementation of new control strategies can benefit from the application of mathematical models that allow the simulation of different strategies in different scenarios. Selecting the best strategy to be implemented is also supported by cost-effectiveness studies. Here we used the results of a mathematical model in which scenarios, including isolated use of the vaccine and insecticide-impregnated collar (IIC), both at different coverage rates, were simulated to conduct a cost-effectiveness study. The costs were calculated for each scenario considering a simulation period of four years. Collar application in both infected and non-infected animals was the most cost-effective strategy. For example, to reduce the prevalence in humans and dogs by approximately 70\%, the costs ranged from \$250,000 and \$550,000 for the IICs and vaccination, respectively. Even in the scenario with 40\% loss/replacement of IICs, this measure was more advantageous in terms of cost-effectiveness than vaccination. If the vaccine were applied with culling of seropositive tested dogs, then the measure became more effective with a reduced cost compared with the vaccine alone. The use of the three first consecutive vaccine doses had the greatest impact on the cost of the vaccination strategy. The advantage of using IICs is that there is no need for a prior diagnosis, unlike vaccination, reducing costs and facilitating implementation. The present study aims to contribute to strategies to reduce hosts infected with VL by reducing public expenditure.},

First we analyzed (i) existing associations between canine epidemiological indicators, where the dependent variable was the canine seroprevalence A (2007 to 2013), and the independent variables were, as follows: canine seroprevalence B (2006 to 2012); percentage of positive dogs by ELISA test reagents that were not euthanized; the relationship between the human and canine population; canine population testing coverage by census surveys; and the years of study (2006 to 2013); (ii) then, we examined the association between human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL) cases between 2007 to 2013 and the mentioned variables related to dogs and years. Statistical analysis was done by a generalized linear model (GLM). One unit increases in canine seroprevalence B and canine seroprevalence A were associated to 13\% and 12\% increases in HVL rates, respectively. The increase in one human/dog ratio unit was associated with a 13\% decrease in HVL rates. Canine seroprevalence, human/dog ratio and non-euthanasia of ELISA-reactive dogs in the environment were adequate indicators for analyzing the canine enzootic transmission and the occurrence of HVL cases.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Estimate the coverage of control measures of visceral leishmaniasis and relate them with the occurrence of human visceral leishmaniasis in endemic urban area. METHODS: Cases of human and canine visceral leishmaniasis were considered as study population and evaluated by a serological survey conducted in Araçatuba, state São Paulo, from 2007 to 2015. The cases of human visceral leishmaniasis were geocoded by the address of the patients and the canine disease by the address of the dogs’ owners. The coverage of serological survey, euthanasia, and insecticide spraying was calculated, as well as the canine seroprevalence and the incidence rates of human visceral leishmaniasis. The relationship between human visceral leishmaniasis and control measures was evaluated, as well as the seroprevalence by comparing maps and by linear regression. The relationship between the canine and the human disease was also evaluated by the Ripley’s K function. RESULTS: The incidence rates of human visceral leishmaniasis showed a period of decline (2007 to 2009) and a period of stability (2010 to 2015), a behavior similar to that of canine seroprevalence. In general, the coverage of control measures was low, and the non-association with the incidence of human visceral leishmaniasis can be a result of the period analyzed and of the small number of analyzed units (sectors of the Superintendence for the Control of Endemic Diseases). The distribution of human cases showed spatial dependence with the distribution of seropositive dogs from 2007 to 2009. CONCLUSIONS: This study reaffirmed the relationship between the occurrence of the disease in humans and dogs, it verified a decrease in the rates of visceral leishmaniasis in Araçatuba over time, even at low coverage of control activities. However, further studies are needed to determine if factors beyond monitoring and control measures are involved in the reduction of incidences.},

            Abstract: The expansion of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) transmission areas in Brazil raises questions concerning the country's control strategies. The guidelines of the Brazilian Visceral Leishmaniasis Control Program (PVCLC) focus on decreases in morbidity and case-fatality, reservoir and vector control, and health education. This article assesses difficulties in implementing the measures recommended by the PVCLC, according to the program's coordinators in large cities with canine and/or human transmission (Campinas, Bauru, Goiânia, Campo Grande, Fortaleza, and Belo Horizonte). Semi-structured interviews identified the following main problems: discontinuity of control activities, resistance to canine euthanasia by dog owners, and low coverage of chemical vector control. Conclusion: the interviews revealed numerous obstacles to implementation of the measures proposed by the PVCLC and a clear need to reassess Brazil's VL policy.

	abstract = {Background: Visceral leishmaniasis belongs to the list of neglected tropical diseases and is considered a public health problem worldwide. Spatial correlation between the occurrence of the disease in humans and high rates of canine infection suggests that in the presence of the vector, canine visceral leishmaniasis is the key factor for triggering transmission to humans. Despite the control strategies implemented, such as the sacrifice of infected dogs being put down, the incidence of American visceral leishmaniasis remains high in many Latin American countries.
Methodology/Principal Findings: Mathematical models were developed to describe the transmission dynamics of canine leishmaniasis and its control by culling. Using these models, imperfect control scenarios were implemented to verify the possible factors which alter the effectiveness of controlling this disease in practice.
Conclusions/Significance: A long-term continuous program targeting both asymptomatic and symptomatic dogs should be effective in controlling canine leishmaniasis in areas of low to moderate transmission (R0 up to 1.4). However, the indiscriminate sacrifice of asymptomatic dogs with positive diagnosis may jeopardize the effectiveness of the control program, if tests with low specificity are used, increasing the chance of generating outrage in the population, and leading to lower adherence to the program. Therefore, culling must be planned accurately and implemented responsibly and never as a mechanical measure in large scale. In areas with higher transmission, culling alone is not an effective control strategy.},

Parasitism often occurs in bone marrow, but changes have been observed in peripheral blood and serum biochemical parameters. The aim of this study was to evaluate the hematological and biochemical parameters in dogs naturally infected by Leishmania chagasi. Methods: Eighty-five adult dogs of both sexes and various weights and ages from the Zoonosis Control Center of Fortaleza (CCZ) were used, selected by immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and considered positive with IFA titers greater than 1:40 and by visualizing amastigotes of Leishmania chagasi in smears obtained by bone marrow aspiration. The dogs (n = 85) were grouped according to clinical signs: negative (CN = 7), subclinical (CS = 10), and clinical (CC = 68). Blood samples were collected for determination of hematological and biochemical serum values. The experimental protocol was approved by the CEUA/UECE. Results: The most frequent clinical signs were cachexia (77.9\%), keratitis (61.8\%), and lymphadenopathy (55.9\%), and 86.8\% of the animals showed more than one clinical sign characteristic of CVL. In CC were observed reductions in red blood cells (63\%), hematocrit (72\%), and hemoglobin (62\%), as well as leukocytosis (33\%), neutropenia (28\%), thrombocytopenia (50\%), uremia (45\%), hyperproteinemia (53\%, p{\textless}0.05), hypergammaglobulinemia (62\%, p{\textless}0.01), and hypoalbuminemia (58\%). Conclusions: Animals with the clinical form of the disease demonstrate hematological and biochemical changes consistent with anemia, uremia, hyperproteinemia, and hyperglobulinemia, which present themselves as strong clinical markers of visceral leishmaniasis associated with the signs previously reported.},

	abstract = {Background: Leishmania parasites express various essential proteins in different growth phases (logarithmic/ stationary) and forms (promastigote/amastigote). Targeting the genes encoding such proteins paves the way for controlling these parasites. Centrin is an essential gene, which its protein product seems to be vital for the proliferation of Leishmania parasites. Herein, this study was contrived to analyze the expression level of the centrin gene in different growth phases and forms of Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) parasites isolated from various endemic areas of canine leishmaniasis (CanL) in Iran.
Results: All three collected isolates were identified as L. infantum using polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR-RFLP). Real-time reverse transcription (RT)-PCR revealed a statistically significant up-regulation (3.13-fold) in the logarithmic phase promastigotes compared to stationary ones (p {\textless} 0.01), whereas centrin was expressed equally in intracellular amastigotes at different time points during cell culture. Also, our finding revealed a slight up-regulation of the centrin gene (1.22-fold) in the intracellular amastigotes compared to logarithmic phase promastigotes, which was found statistically non-significant (p {\textgreater} 0.05).
Conclusions: Centrin gene in Iranian isolates of L. infantum is more expressed in exponential than stationary phases and seems to be considered as a promising target in the development of a genetically modified live attenuated vaccine for CanL control.},

              Leishmaniasis is a neglected tropical disease caused by

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis is a growing health problem in many parts of the world and efforts to ﬁnd vaccine against the disease are a public health priority. Live attenuated vaccines are the gold standard for protection against intracellular pathogens such as Leishmania spp. Deﬁned genetic alteration of the Leishmania genome can be achieved using a gene-targeted disruption strategy that allows for the selection of parasites lacking genes essential for long-term survival and virulence. Previously, we demonstrated that genetically modiﬁed live attenuated Leishmania major, lacking the p27gene (Lmp27À/À) is safe and induces cellular immunity in BALB/c mice. p27 is a component of the COX complex that is responsible for ATP synthesis. In the current study, the Lmp27À/À strain was assessed as a live attenuated vaccine. Overall protective immunity and efﬁcacy were evaluated at various time periods following Leishmania major (L. major) and Leishmania infantum (L. infantum) challenges separately in BALB/c mice. Cytokine and anti-Leishmania antibody levels, splenocyte proliferation, delayed type hypersensitivity (DTH), skin lesion development, and parasite burden in the liver and spleen were the measured variables. The results demonstrated that immunized mice had a signiﬁcant T-helper type 1 (Th1) response, smaller skin lesions and lower parasite burdens in their liver and spleens following a L. major challenge. Furthermore, the Lmp27À/À mutant also granted cross-protection against L. infantum infection.},

	abstract = {Background Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is a neglected tropical disease and is fatal if untreated. There is no vaccine available against leishmaniasis. The majority of patients with cutaneous leishmaniasis (CL) or VL develop a long-term protective immunity after cure from infection, which indicates that development of an effective vaccine against leishmaniasis is possible. Such protection may also be achieved by immunization with live attenuated parasites that do not cause disease. We have previously reported a protective response in mice, hamsters and dogs with Leishmania donovani centrin gene knock-out parasites (LdCen-/-), a live attenuated parasite with a cell division specific centrin1 gene deletion. In this study we have explored the effects of salivary protein LJM19 as an adjuvant and intradermal (ID) route of immunization on the efficacy of LdCen-/- parasites as a vaccine against virulent L. donovani.},

	abstract = {The arbitrary-primed PCR (AP-PCR) technique was employed with the twin goals of identifying genetic polymorphisms within the Indian isolates and to identify diﬀerentially expressed gene sequences. The parasite isolates from Indian Kala-azar patients could be diﬀerentiated from Leishmania donovani isolates from distinct geographic regions. Moreover, diﬀerences within the Indian isolates could also be identiﬁed. A majority (17/19) of the Indian isolates gave identical AP-PCR pattern, while two isolates gave consistently divergent pattern. The distinctive AP-PCR fragments obtained with Indian isolates were used as probes in Northern blot analysis. Three such fragments were found to represent transcribed sequences that were diﬀerentially expressed in the two stages of the parasite. These sequences led to cloning and characterization of Leishmania Centrin gene and a novel gene termed A-1 that is over-expressed in amastigote stage of the parasite. The study demonstrates the utility of random genome sampling methods in genomic ﬁngerprinting and in identifying diﬀerentially transcribed sequences that could potentially contribute to parasite virulence.},

Therefore, it may help design conservation priorities for some threatened species, such as anurans. Herein, we describe the karyotypes of Scinax constrictus and Ololygon centralis, native endemic species from the Brazilian Cerrado. Chromosome preparations for both species were stained with Giemsa for morphological analyses and then impregnated by the Ag-NOR method for localization of the nucleolar organizer region (NOR). Both species had 24 chromosomes, as confirmed by meiotic analyses, which showed 12 bivalents. Chromosome morphologies presented the same pattern for Scinax and Ololygon compared to species already karyotyped in both genera. The NOR was interstitially located in the long arm of pair 7 in S. constrictus, whereas in O. centralis it was found near the centromere in the long arm of pair 1, thus diverging from what is commonly found for other Ololygon species. Therefore, we provide the first description of the karyotype of O. centralis and the first report of the localization of the NOR for the karyotype of both species. Our study increases the cytogenetic knowledge in species of the genera Scinax and Ololygon, and provide support for further studies on the taxonomy, ecology, and evolution of hylid anurans.},

	abstract = {Kinetoplastid parasites exhibit a rich and diverse biology which mirrors many of the most interesting topics of current interest and study in the broader biological sciences. These evolutionarily ancient organisms possess intriguing mechanisms for control of gene expression, and exhibit complex patterns of cell morphogenesis orchestrated by an internal cytoskeleton. Their cell shapes change during a set of complex cell type differentiations in their life cycles. These differentiations are intimately linked to interactions with mammalian hosts or insect vectors, and often, these differentiations appear central to the successful transfer of the parasite between vector and host, and host and vector. The basics of this rich and complex cell and life cycle biology were described (with often rather forgotten clarity and prescience) in the early period of the last century. The last 30 years have seen major developments in our understanding of this biology. Ultrastructural differences in the various cells of the life cycle stages of Trypanosoma brucei, Trypanosoma cruzi and the various Leishmania species have been documented, and such studies have proven highly informative in de®ning important aspects of parasite adaptation. They have also proven to be a rich source of information for de®ning unusual aspects of parasite cell biology, novel organelles and cell architecture. This ultrastructural cell biology has been mirrored in a set of biochemical explanations de®ning unusual aspects of metabolism, surface molecules, and organelles. Finally, the application of molecular biology to these parasites revealed fascinating layers of complexity in the control of gene expression. These molecular studies have given us particular insights into polycistronic transcription, trans-splicing, RNA editing and gene rearrangements during antigenic variation. In contrast to other microbial systems, these cell biological, biochemical and molecular studies have not been greatly aided by insights gained from genetics ± the diploid nature of the genome has discouraged the application of selectional genetics, mutant isolation and analysis. This is an important fact, since in general, it means that we have only recently started to analyse the phenotypes of mutants produced in the context of reverse genetics. In the following, I will argue that this lack of investment in the analysis of mutant phenotype is just one of the challenges that will need to be met if we are to gain the expected added value from the parasite genome projects. In this presentation, I will use some of the current areas of interest in the biology of T. brucei, T. cruzi and the Leishmania species to rehearse some of the insights and challenges that are likely to stem from the application of genomics and post-genomic studies to the kinetoplastid parasites. In some cases, I will exemplify points by illustrations from my laboratory's work, interests and hypotheses. The presentation slants therefore towards T. brucei biology, however, in each case the reader will, no doubt, see the generalities of application to other kinetoplastid parasites. q 2001 Australian Society for Parasitology Inc.

Only little is known about external or intrinsic factors that govern Leishmania genomic adaptation. Here, by conducting longitudinal genome analyses of 10 new Leishmania clinical isolates, we uncovered important differences in gene copy number among genetically highly related strains and revealed gain and loss of gene copies as potential drivers of long-term environmental adaptation in the ﬁeld. In contrast, chromosome rather than gene ampliﬁcation was associated with short-term environmental adaptation to in vitro culture. Karyotypic solutions were highly reproducible but unique for a given strain, suggesting that chromosome ampliﬁcation is under positive selection and dependent on species- and strain-speciﬁc intrinsic factors. We revealed a progressive increase in read depth towards the chromosome ends for various Leishmania isolates, which may represent a nonclassical mechanism of telomere maintenance that can preserve integrity of chromosome ends during selection for fast in vitro growth. Together our data draw a complex picture of Leishmania genomic adaptation in the ﬁeld and in culture, which is driven by a combination of intrinsic genetic factors that generate strain-speciﬁc phenotypic variations, which are under environmental selection and allow for ﬁtness gain.},

	abstract = {Leishmaniasis is one of the major neglected tropical diseases, for which no vaccines exist. Chemotherapy is hampered by limited efficacy coupled with development of resistance and other side effects. Leishmania parasites elude the host defensive mechanisms by modulating their surface proteins as well as dampening the host's immune responses. The parasites use the conventional RNA polymerases peculiarly under different environmental cues or pressures such as the host's milieu or the drugs. The mechanisms that restructure post-translational modifications are poorly understood but altered epigenetic histone modifications are believed to be instrumental in influencing the chromatin remodeling in the parasite. Interestingly, the parasite also modulates gene expression of the hosts, thereby hijacking or dampening the host immune response. Epigenetic factor such as DNA methylation of cytosine residues has been incriminated in silencing of macrophage-specific genes responsible for defense against these parasites. Although there is dearth of information regarding the epigenetic alterations-mediated pathogenesis in these parasites and the host, the unique epigenetic marks may represent targets for potential anti-leishmanial drug candidates. This review circumscribes the epigenetic changes during Leishmania infection, and the epigenetic modifications they enforce upon the host cells to ensure a safe haven. The non-coding micro RNAs as post-transcriptional regulators and correlates of wound healing and toll-like receptor signaling, as well as prognostic biomarkers of therapeutic failure and healing time are also explored. Finally, we highlight the recent advances on how the epigenetic perturbations may impact leishmaniasis vaccine development as biomarkers of safety and immunogenicity.},

	abstract = {Cutaneous leishmaniasis is a parasitic infection caused by a flagellated parasite belonging to the genus Leishmania. In most cases, it is a zoonotic disease transmitted via a bite by bloodsucking sand-flies of the genus Phlebotomus. The disease reservoirs consist of wild or semi-domesticated animals, generally rodents or dogs. The disease itself is distributed extensively worldwide in the Americas, Asia, Europe and Africa. Epidemiology is affected by environmental, migratory and climatic factors. Identification of the different types of leishmaniasis is based chiefly on the biochemical characteristics (isoenzymes) on which their classification is based. The offending parasites are dimorphic intracellular organisms within the phagosome of the host's immune cells, and a single-cell flagellated protozoan with a kinetoplast contained in the gut of the vector and in culture. Three major clinical forms are seen: cutaneous leishmaniasis, mucosal leishmaniasis and visceral leishmaniasis. The clinical presentation depends on factors associated with the virulence of the parasite, with individual immune response and with the site of lesions. Although each type of leishmaniasis may have its own specific cutaneous signs and endemic regions, the most common presentations are crusted, ulcerated nodules and plaques. The natural history of leishmaniasis must also be considered when formulating therapeutic strategies. Cutaneous leishmaniasis resolves spontaneously within between one month and six years. While numerous therapeutic options have been considered in recent decades, very few have shown proven efficacy and safety. Antimony compounds administered either directly to the lesion or parenterally remain the standard treatment and their toxicity calls for vigilance and monitoring of therapy.},

	abstract = {As part of a World Health Organization-led effort to update the empirical evidence base for the leishmaniases, national experts provided leishmaniasis case data for the last 5 years and information regarding treatment and control in their respective countries and a comprehensive literature review was conducted covering publications on leishmaniasis in 98 countries and three territories (see 'Leishmaniasis Country Profiles Text S1, S2, S3, S4, S5, S6, S7, S8, S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S16, S17, S18, S19, S20, S21, S22, S23, S24, S25, S26, S27, S28, S29, S30, S31, S32, S33, S34, S35, S36, S37, S38, S39, S40, S41, S42, S43, S44, S45, S46, S47, S48, S49, S50, S51, S52, S53, S54, S55, S56, S57, S58, S59, S60, S61, S62, S63, S64, S65, S66, S67, S68, S69, S70, S71, S72, S73, S74, S75, S76, S77, S78, S79, S80, S81, S82, S83, S84, S85, S86, S87, S88, S89, S90, S91, S92, S93, S94, S95, S96, S97, S98, S99, S100, S101'). Additional information was collated during meetings conducted at WHO regional level between 2007 and 2011. Two questionnaires regarding epidemiology and drug access were completed by experts and national program managers. Visceral and cutaneous leishmaniasis incidence ranges were estimated by country and epidemiological region based on reported incidence, underreporting rates if available, and the judgment of national and international experts. Based on these estimates, approximately 0.2 to 0.4 cases and 0.7 to 1.2 million VL and CL cases, respectively, occur each year. More than 90\% of global VL cases occur in six countries: India, Bangladesh, Sudan, South Sudan, Ethiopia and Brazil. Cutaneous leishmaniasis is more widely distributed, with about one-third of cases occurring in each of three epidemiological regions, the Americas, the Mediterranean basin, and western Asia from the Middle East to Central Asia. The ten countries with the highest estimated case counts, Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica and Peru, together account for 70 to 75\% of global estimated CL incidence. Mortality data were extremely sparse and generally represent hospital-based deaths only. Using an overall case-fatality rate of 10\%, we reach a tentative estimate of 20,000 to 40,000 leishmaniasis deaths per year. Although the information is very poor in a number of countries, this is the first in-depth exercise to better estimate the real impact of leishmaniasis. These data should help to define control strategies and reinforce leishmaniasis advocacy.},

	abstract = {Genome editing technology based on engineered nucleases has been increasingly applied for targeted modification of genes in a variety of cell types and organisms. However, the methods currently used for evaluating the editing efficiency still suffer from many limitations, including preferential detection of some mutation types, sensitivity to polymorphisms that hamper mismatch detection, lack of multiplex capability, or sensitivity to assay conditions. Here, we describe qEva-CRISPR, a new quantitative method that overcomes these limitations and allows simultaneous (multiplex) analysis of CRISPR/Cas9-induced modifications in a target and the corresponding off-targets or in several different targets. We demonstrate all of the advantages of the qEva-CRISPR method using a number of sgRNAs targeting the TP53, VEGFA, CCR5, EMX1 and HTT genes in different cell lines and under different experimental conditions. Unlike other methods, qEva-CRISPR detects all types of mutations, including point mutations and large deletions, and its sensitivity does not depend on the mutation type. Moreover, this approach allows for successful analysis of targets located in 'difficult' genomic regions. In conclusion, qEva-CRISPR may become a method of choice for unbiased sgRNA screening to evaluate experimental conditions that affect genome editing or to distinguish homology-directed repair from non-homologous end joining.},

	abstract = {Classical nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequences have been used for artificial localization of green fluorescent protein (GFP) in the nucleus as a positioning marker or for measurement of the nuclear-cytoplasmic shuttling rate in living cells. However, the detailed mechanism of nuclear retention of GFP-NLS remains unclear. Here, we show that a candidate mechanism for the strong nuclear retention of GFP-NLS is via the RNA-binding ability of the NLS sequence. GFP tagged with a classical NLS derived from Simian virus 40 (GFP-NLS(SV40)) localized not only in the nucleoplasm, but also to the nucleolus, the nuclear subdomain in which ribosome biogenesis takes place. GFP-NLS(SV40) in the nucleolus was mobile, and intriguingly, the diffusion coefficient, which indicates the speed of diffusing molecules, was 1.5-fold slower than in the nucleoplasm. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) analysis showed that GFP-NLS(SV40) formed oligomers via RNA binding, the estimated molecular weight of which was larger than the limit for passive nuclear export into the cytoplasm. These findings suggest that the nuclear localization of GFP-NLS(SV40) likely results from oligomerization mediated via RNA binding. The analytical technique used here can be applied for elucidating the details of other nuclear localization mechanisms, including those of several types of nuclear proteins. In addition, GFP-NLS(SV40) can be used as an excellent marker for studying both the nucleoplasm and nucleolus in living cells.},

After purification of the plasmid DNA, specific probes of the defined DNA fragments, which contained the cloned insert and short stretches of the vector DNA, were generated by restriction endonuclease. The enzymatic digestion pattern of the BrdUrd-labeled plasmid DNA was the same as that of the non-labeled one. BrdUrd was incorporated in 15\%-20\% of the total DNA, that is, about 80\% of the thymidine was replaced by BrdUrd. Picogram amounts of the BrdUrd-labeled DNA probe itself and the target DNA were detectable on nitrocellulose filters in dot-blot spot and hybridization experiments using a peroxidase/diaminobenzidine combination. The BrdUrd-labeled DNA probe was efficiently hybridized with both single stranded DNA on nitrocellulose filters and cellular mRNA in in situ hybridization experiments. Through the reaction with BrdUrd in single stranded tails, hybridized probes were clearly detectable with fluorescent microscopy using a FITC-conjugated monoclonal anti-BrdUrd antibody.

Cysteine peptidases play crucial role in pathogenicity and virulence in Leishmania spp. and are promising targets for developing new antileishmanial drugs. Genetic drug target validation has been performed on a number of cysteine peptidases, but others have yet to be characterized. We targeted 16 L. mexicana cysteine peptidases for gene deletion and tagging using CRISPR-Cas9 in order to identify essential genes and ascertain their cellular localization. Our analysis indicates that two clan CA, family C2 calpains (LmCAL27.1, LmCAL31.6) and clan CD, family C11 PNT1 are essential for survival in the promastigote stage. The other peptidases analysed, namely calpains LmCAL4.1, LmCAL25.1, and members of clan CA C51, C78, C85 and clan CP C97 were found to be non-essential. We generated a gene deletion mutant (Dpnt1) which was severely compromised in its cell growth and a conditional gene deletion mutant of PNT1 (Dpnt1: PNT1ﬂox/D pnt1:HYG [SSU DiCRE]). PNT1 localizes to distinct foci on the ﬂagellum and on the surface of the parasite. The conditional gene deletion of PNT1 induced blebs and pits on the cell surface and eventual cell death. Over-expression of PNT1, but not an active site mutant PNT1C134A, was lethal, suggesting that active PNT1 peptidase is required for parasite survival. Overall, our data suggests that PNT1 is an essential gene and one of a number of cysteine peptidases that are potential drug targets in Leishmania.},

Here, we found that parasites lacking the pnc1 gene (Dpnc1) are hypersusceptible to the active form of antimony (SbIII) and used these mutant parasites to better understand antimony’s mode of action and the mechanisms leading to resistance.
Methods: SbIII-resistant WT and Dpnc1 parasites were selected in vitro by a stepwise selection method. NAD(H)/NADP(H) dosages and quantitative RT–PCR experiments were performed to explain the susceptibility differences observed between strains. WGS and a marker-free CRISPR/Cas9 base-editing approach were used to identify and validate the role of a new resistance mutation.
Results: NAD!-depleted Dpnc1 parasites were highly susceptible to SbIII and this phenotype could be rescued by NAD! precursor or trypanothione precursor supplementation. Dpnc1 parasites could become resistant to SbIII by an unknown mechanism. WGS revealed a unique amino acid substitution (H451Y) in an EF-hand domain of an orphan calcium-dependent kinase, recently named SCAMK. When introduced into a WT reference strain by base editing, the H451Y mutation allowed Leishmania parasites to survive at extreme concentrations of SbIII, potentiating the rapid emergence of resistant parasites.
Conclusions: These results establish that Leishmania SCAMK is a new central hub of antimony’s mode of action and resistance development, and uncover the importance of drug tolerance mutations in the evolution of parasite drug resistance.},

This technology, which is simple, inexpensive and eﬃcient, has aroused a lot of enthusiasm in the scientiﬁc community since its discovery, and every month many publications emanate from very diﬀerent communities reporting on the use of CRISPR-Cas9. Currently, there are no vaccines to control neglected tropical diseases (NTDs) caused by Trypanosomatidae, particularly Human African Trypanosomiasis (HAT) and Animal African Trypanosomoses (AAT), and treatments are cumbersome and sometimes not eﬀective enough. CRISPR-Cas9 has the potential to functionally analyze new target molecules that could be used for therapeutic and vaccine purposes. In this review, after brieﬂy describing CRIPSR-Cas9 history and how it works, diﬀerent applications on diseases, especially on parasitic diseases, are reviewed. We then focus the review on the use of CRISPR-Cas9 editing on Trypanosomatidae parasites, the causative agents of NTDs, which are still a terrible burden for human populations in tropical regions, and their vectors.},

	abstract = {DNA double strand breaks (DSBs) are potential lethal lesions but can also lead to chromosome rearrangements, a step promoting carcinogenesis. DNA non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) is the major DSB rejoining process and occurs in all cell cycle stages. Homologous recombination (HR) can additionally function to repair irradiation-induced two-ended DSBs in G2 phase. In mammalian cells, HR predominantly uses a sister chromatid as a template for DSB repair; thus HR functions only in late S/G2 phase. Here, we review current insight into the interplay between HR and NHEJ in G2 phase. We argue that NHEJ represents the first choice pathway, repairing approximately 80\% of X-ray-induced DSBs with rapid kinetics. However, a subset of DSBs undergoes end resection and repair by HR. 53BP1 restricts resection, thereby promoting NHEJ. During the switch from NHEJ to HR, 53BP1 is repositioned to the periphery of enlarged irradiation-induced foci (IRIF) via a BRCA1-dependent process. K63-linked ubiquitin chains, which also form at IRIF, are also repositioned as well as receptor-associated protein 80 (RAP80), a ubiquitin binding protein. RAP80 repositioning requires POH1, a proteasome component. Thus, the interfacing barriers to HR, 53BP1 and RAP80 are relieved by POH1 and BRCA1, respectively. Removal of RAP80 from the IRIF core is required for loss of the ubiquitin chains and 53BP1, and for efficient replication protein A foci formation. We propose that NHEJ is used preferentially to HR because it is a compact process that does not necessitate extensive chromatin changes in the DSB vicinity.},

The non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway is considered a major route for the repair DSB in mammalian cells. Although the mechanism(s) by which repair of DSB lead to leukemia are poorly understood, recent evidence is beginning to emerge that a poorly deﬁned and error-prone branch of the NHEJ pathway plays a pivotal role in this process.

	abstract = {CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing relies on an efﬁcient double-strand DNA break (DSB) and repair. Contrary to mammalian cells, the protozoan parasite Leishmania lacks the most efﬁcient nonhomologous end-joining pathway and uses microhomologymediated end joining (MMEJ) and, occasionally, homology-directed repair to repair DSBs. Here, we reveal that Leishmania predominantly uses single-strand annealing (SSA) (Ͼ90\%) instead of MMEJ (Ͻ10\%) for DSB repair (DSBR) following CRISPR targeting of the miltefosine transporter gene, resulting in 9-, 18-, 20-, and 29-kb sequence deletions and multiple gene codeletions. Strikingly, when targeting the Leishmania donovani LdBPK\_241510 gene, SSA even occurred by using direct repeats 77 kb apart, resulting in the codeletion of 15 Leishmania genes, though with a reduced frequency. These data strongly indicate that DSBR is not efﬁcient in Leishmania, which explains why more than half of DSBs led to cell death and why the CRISPR gene-targeting efﬁciency is low compared with that in other organisms. Since direct repeat sequences are widely distributed in the Leishmania genome, we predict that many DSBs created by CRISPR are repaired by SSA. It is also revealed that DNA polymerase theta is involved in both MMEJ and SSA in Leishmania. Collectively, this study establishes that DSBR mechanisms and their competence in an organism play an important role in determining the outcome and efﬁcacy of CRISPR gene targeting. These observations emphasize the use of donor DNA templates to improve gene editing speciﬁcity and efﬁciency in Leishmania. In addition, we developed a novel Staphylococcus aureus Cas9 constitutive expression vector (pLdSaCN) for gene targeting in Leishmania.},

In line with the heteroxenous nature of these parasites, the different LeishIF4E paralogs vary in their biophysical features and their biological behavior. We therefore hypothesize that each has a specialized function, not limited to protein synthesis. Of the six paralogs, LeishIF4E-3 has a weak cap-binding activity. It participates in the assembly of granules that store inactive transcripts and ribosomal proteins during nutritional stress that is experienced in the sand ﬂy. We investigated the role of LeishIF4E-3 in Leishmania mexicana promastigotes using the CRISPR-Cas9 system. We deleted one of the two LeishIF4E-3 alleles, generating a heterologous deletion mutant with reduced LeishIF4E-3 expression. The mutant showed a decline in de novo protein synthesis and growth kinetics, altered morphology, and impaired infectivity. The mutant cells were rounded and failed to transform into the nectomonad-like form, in response to purine starvation. Furthermore, the infectivity of macrophage cells by the LeishIF4E-3(ϩ/Ϫ) mutant was severely reduced. These phenotypic features were not observed in the addback cells, in which expression of LeishIF4E-3 was restored. The observed phenotypic changes correlated with the proﬁle of transcripts associated with LeishIF4E-3.

Promastigote forms in the sand fly have a long flagellum, which is motile and used for anchoring the parasites to prevent clearance with the digested blood meal remnants. To dissect flagellar functions and their importance in life cycle progression, we generated here a comprehensive list of {\textgreater}300 flagellar proteins and produced a CRISPR-Cas9 gene knockout library of 100 mutant
              Leishmania
              . We studied their behaviour
              in vitro
              before examining their fate in the sand fly
              Lutzomyia longipalpis
              . Measuring mutant swimming speeds showed that about half behaved differently compared to the wild type: a few swam faster, many slower and some were completely paralysed. We also found a group of uncoordinated swimmers. To test whether flagellar motility is required for parasite migration from the fly midgut to the foregut from where they reach the next host, we infected sand flies with a mixed mutant population. Each mutant carried a unique tag and tracking these tags up to nine days after infection showed that paralysed and uncoordinated
              Leishmania
              were rapidly lost from flies. These data indicate that directional swimming is important for successful colonisation of sand flies.},

	abstract = {CRISPR-Cas9-mediated genome editing has recently been adapted for Leishmania spp. parasites, the causative agents of human leishmaniasis. We have optimized this genome-editing tool by selecting for cells with CRISPR-Cas9 activity through cotargeting the miltefosine transporter gene; mutation of this gene leads to miltefosine resistance. This cotargeting strategy integrated into a triple guide RNA (gRNA) expression vector was used to delete all 11 copies of the A2 multigene family; this was not previously possible with the traditional gene-targeting method. We found that the Leishmania donovani rRNA promoter is more efﬁcient than the U6 promoter in driving gRNA expression, and sequential transfections of the oligonucleotide donor signiﬁcantly eased the isolation of edited mutants. A gRNA and Cas9 coexpression vector was developed that was functional in all tested Leishmania species, including L. donovani, L. major, and L. mexicana. By simultaneously targeting sites from two different chromosomes, all four types of targeted chromosomal translocations were generated, regardless of the polycistronic transcription direction from the parent chromosomes. It was possible to use this CRISPR system to create a single conserved amino acid substitution (A189G) mutation for both alleles of RAD51, a DNA recombinase involved in homology-directed repair. We found that RAD51 is essential for L. donovani survival based on direct observation of the death of mutants with both RAD51 alleles disrupted, further conﬁrming that this CRISPR system can reveal gene essentiality. Evidence is also provided that microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) plays a major role in double-strand DNA break repair in L. donovani.},

	abstract = {The prokaryotic CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat)-Cas9, an RNA-guided endonuclease, has been shown to mediate efﬁcient genome editing in a wide variety of organisms. In the present study, the CRISPR-Cas9 system has been adapted to Leishmania donovani, a protozoan parasite that causes fatal human visceral leishmaniasis. We introduced the Cas9 nuclease into L. donovani and generated guide RNA (gRNA) expression vectors by using the L. donovani rRNA promoter and the hepatitis delta virus (HDV) ribozyme. It is demonstrated within that L. donovani mainly used homologydirected repair (HDR) and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) to repair the Cas9 nuclease-created double-strand DNA break (DSB). The nonhomologous end-joining (NHEJ) pathway appears to be absent in L. donovani. With this CRISPRCas9 system, it was possible to generate knockouts without selection by insertion of an oligonucleotide donor with stop codons and 25-nucleotide homology arms into the Cas9 cleavage site. Likewise, we disrupted and precisely tagged endogenous genes by inserting a bleomycin drug selection marker and GFP gene into the Cas9 cleavage site. With the use of Hammerhead and HDV ribozymes, a double-gRNA expression vector that further improved gene-targeting efﬁciency was developed, and it was used to make precise deletion of the 3-kb miltefosine transporter gene (LdMT). In addition, this study identiﬁed a novel single point mutation caused by CRISPR-Cas9 in LdMT (M381T) that led to miltefosine resistance, a concern for the only available oral antileishmanial drug. Together, these results demonstrate that the CRISPR-Cas9 system represents an effective genome engineering tool for L. donovani. IMPORTANCE Leishmania donovani is the causative agent of fatal visceral leishmaniasis. To understand Leishmania infection and pathogenesis and identify new drug targets for control of leishmaniasis, more-efﬁcient ways to manipulate this parasite genome are required. In this study, we have implemented CRISPR-Cas9 genome-editing technology in L. donovani. Both singleand dual-gRNA expression vectors were developed using a strong RNA polymerase I promoter and ribozymes. With this system, it was possible to generate loss-of-function insertion and deletion mutations and introduce drug selection markers and the GFP sequence precisely into the L. donovani genome. These methods greatly improved the ability to manipulate this parasite genome and will help pave the way for high-throughput functional analysis of Leishmania genes. This study further revealed that doublestranded DNA breaks created by CRISPR-Cas9 were repaired by the homology-directed repair (HDR) pathway and microhomology-mediated end joining (MMEJ) in Leishmania.},

	abstract = {Background: Gene manipulation strategies including gene knockout and editing are becoming more sophisticated in terms of mechanism of action, efficacy and ease of use. In classical molecular methods of gene knockout, homologous arms are designed for induction of crossing over event in double strand DNA. Recently, CRISPR/Cas9 system has been emerged as a precise and powerful tool for gene targeting. In this effort, we aimed to generate a CRISPR/Cas9-based vector specific for targeting genes in Leishmania parasites.
Methods: U6 and DHFR promoters and neomycin-resistance gene were amplified from genome of L. major (MHRO/IR/75/ER) and pEGFP-N1, respectively. U6 promoter was cloned in pX330 vector which is named as pX330-U6. DHFR promoter and neo resistance gene sequence fragments were fused using a combination of SOE (Splicing by overlap extension)-PCR and T/A cloning techniques. To generate pX-leish, fused fragments su-bcloned into the pX330-U6. Two sgRNAs were designed to target the gp63 gene and cloned in pX-leish.
Results: The pX-leish vector was designed for simultaneous expression of cas9 and G418 resistance proteins along with a self-cleaving 2A peptide for efficient separation of the two proteins. In this study pX-leish was designed with 3 features: 1) Compatible promoters with Leishmania parasites. 2) Insertion of antibiotic selection marker 3) Designing an all-in-one vector containing all components required for CRISPR/Cas9 system.
Conclusion: This modified system would be valuable in genome manipulation studies in Leishmania for vaccine research in future.},

We showed that CK1.1 is a low-abundance protein present in promastigotes and in amastigotes.

	abstract = {Leishmania is a protozoan parasite belonging to the family Trypanosomatidae, which is found among 88 different countries. The parasite lives as an amastigote in vertebrate macrophages and as a promastigote in the digestive tract of sand fly. It can be cultured in the laboratory using appropriate culture media. Although the sexual cycle of Leishmania has not been observed during the promastigote and amastigote stages, it has been reported by some researchers. Leishmania has eukaryotic cell organization. Cell culture is convenient and cost effective, and because posttranslational modifications are common processes in the cultured cells, the cells are used as hosts for preparing eukaryotic recombinant proteins for research. Several transcripts of rDNA in the Leishmania genome are suitable regions for conducting gene transfer. Old World Leishmania spp. has 36 chromosomes, while New World Leishmania spp. has 34 or 35 chromosomes. The genomic organization and parasitic characteristics have been investigated. Leishmania spp. has a unique genomic organization among eukaryotes; the genes do not have introns, and the chromosomes are smaller with larger numbers of genes confined to a smaller space within the nucleus. Leishmania spp. genes are organized on one or both DNA strands and are transcribed as polycistronic (prokaryotic-like) transcripts from undefined promoters. Regulation of gene expression in the members of Trypanosomatidae differs from that in other eukaryotes. The trans-splicing phenomenon is a necessary step for mRNA processing in lower eukaryotes and is observed in Leishmania spp. Another particular feature of RNA editing in Leishmania spp. is that mitochondrial genes encoding respiratory enzymes are edited and transcribed. This review will discuss the chromosomal and mitochondrial (kinetoplast) genomes of Leishmania spp. as well as the phenomenon of RNA editing in the kinetoplast genome.},

            The parasitic protozoan
            Leishmania
            requires proteasomal, autophagic and lysosomal proteolytic pathways to enact the extensive cellular remodelling that occurs during its life cycle. The proteasome is essential for parasite proliferation, yet little is known about the requirement for ubiquitination/deubiquitination processes in growth and differentiation. Activity-based protein profiling of
            L. mexicana
            C12, C19 and C65 deubiquitinating cysteine peptidases (DUBs) revealed DUB activity remains relatively constant during differentiation of procyclic promastigote to amastigote. However, when Bar-seq was applied to a pool of 16 DUB null mutants created in promastigotes using CRISPR-Cas9, significant loss of fitness was observed during differentiation and intracellular infection. DUBs 4, 7, and 13 are required for successful transformation from metacyclic promastigote to amastigote and DUBs 3, 5, 6, 10, 11 and 14 are required for normal amastigote proliferation in mice. DUBs 1, 2, 12 and 16 are essential for promastigote viability and the essential role of DUB2 in establishing infection was demonstrated using DiCre inducible gene deletion
            in vitro
            and
            in vivo
            . DUB2 is found in the nucleus and interacts with nuclear proteins associated with transcription/chromatin dynamics, mRNA splicing and mRNA capping. DUB2 has broad linkage specificity, cleaving all the di-ubiquitin chains except for Lys27 and Met1. Our study demonstrates the crucial role that DUBs play in differentiation and intracellular survival of
            Leishmania
            and that amastigotes are exquisitely sensitive to disruption of ubiquitination homeostasis.
          
          
            Author Summary
            
              Leishmania
              parasites require a variety of protein degradation pathways to enable the parasite to transition through the various life cycle stages that occur in its insect and mammalian hosts. Several enzymes involved in protein degradation in
              Leishmania
              are known to be essential, including a multi-protein complex, the proteasome, but little is known about how proteins are targeted to the proteasome for degradation. Here, we analyse components of the deubiqutination pathway, including twenty cysteine peptidases (DUBs) that remove the posttranslational modifier ubiquitin from substrates tagged for proteasomal degradation. We used chemical probes to measure active enzymes in parasite lysates and genome engineering to create DUB gene deletion mutants. We identified some DUBs that are essential for parasite viability and some that are required for life cycle progression. We carried out a detailed analysis of the essential DUB2, which has broad deubiquitinase activity and is found in the nucleus. This enzyme interacts with nuclear proteins associated with transcription/chromatin dynamics, mRNA splicing and mRNA capping. This work demonstrates the important role that DUBs play in
              Leishmania in vivo
              infection and further validates DUBs as potential drug targets in this parasite.},

All the studied species showed a general trend with the 5S rDNA tandem repeats organized in two distinct size-classes. At the same time, data on 5S rDNA organization in ﬁsh genome were summarized. Previous information on the organization and evolution of 5S rRNA gene arrays in the genome of this vertebrate group are in agreement with the Southern results here presented. Sequences obtained for several ﬁsh species have revealed the occurrence of two distinct 5S rDNA classes characterized by distinct nontranscribed spacer sequences, which are clustered in different chromosomes in some species. Moreover, the 5S rDNA loci are generally distributed in an interstitial position in the chromosomes and they are usually not syntenic to the 45S rDNA. The presence of two classes of 5S rDNA in several non-related ﬁsh species suggests that this could be a common condition for the 5S rRNA gene organization in the ﬁsh genome.},

	doi = {10.1186/s12863-017-0542-2},
	abstract = {Background: The allotetraploid hybrid fish (4nAT) that was created in a previous study through an intergeneric cross between red crucian carp (Carassius auratus red var., ♀) and common carp (Cyprinus carpio L., ♂) provided an excellent platform to investigate the effect of hybridization and polyploidization on the evolution of 5S rDNA. The 5S rDNAs of paternal common carp were made up of a coding sequence (CDS) and a non-transcribed spacer (NTS) unit, and while the 5S rDNAs of maternal red crucian carp contained a CDS and a NTS unit, they also contained a variable number of interposed regions (IPRs). The CDSs of the 5S rDNAs in both parental fishes were conserved, while their NTS units seemed to have been subjected to rapid evolution.
Results: The diploid hybrid 2nF1 inherited all the types of 5S rDNAs in both progenitors and there were no signs of homeologous recombination in the 5S rDNAs of 2nF1 by sequencing of PCR products. We obtained two segments of 5S rDNA with a total length of 16,457 bp from allotetraploid offspring 4nAT through bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) sequencing. Using this sequence together with the 5S rDNA sequences amplified from the genomic DNA of 4nAT, we deduced that the 5S rDNAs of 4nAT might be inherited from the maternal progenitor red crucian carp. Additionally, the IPRs in the 5S rDNAs of 4nAT contained A-repeats and TA-repeats, which was not the case for the IPRs in the 5S rDNAs of 2nF1. We also detected two signals of a 200-bp fragment of 5S rDNA in the chromosomes of parental progenitors and hybrid progenies by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH).
Conclusions: We deduced that during the evolution of 5S rDNAs in different ploidy hybrid fishes, interlocus gene conversion events and tandem repeat insertion events might occurred in the process of polyploidization. This study provided new insights into the relationship among the evolution of 5S rDNAs, hybridization and polyploidization, which were significant in clarifying the genome evolution of polyploid fish.},

	abstract = {Isolates of the etiological agent of Chagas disease, Trypanosoma cruzi, have been subdivided into six subgroups referred to as discrete typing units. The subgroups are related through two distinct hybridisation events: representatives of homozygous discrete typing units I and IIb fused to form discrete typing units IIa and IIc, whose homozygous genotypes have features of both ancestral types; a second fusion between strains of homozygous discrete typing units IIb and IIc created the heterozygous hybrid strains discrete typing units IId and IIe. The intergenic region of the tandemly repeated 5S rRNA array displays four variant sequence classes, allowing the discrimination of ﬁve discrete typing units. The genome project reference strain, CL Brener, is a hybrid discrete typing unit IIe strain that contains both discrete typing unit IIb and IIc classes of 5S rRNA repeats in distinct arrays present on different chromosomes. The CL Brener discrete typing unit IIb-type array contains approximately 193 repeated units, of which about one-third contain a 129 bp sequence that replaces a majority of the 5S rRNA sequence. The 129 bp ‘invader’ sequence was detected within the arrays of all hybrid discrete typing unit IId and IIe strains and in a subset of discrete typing unit IIb strains. This array invader replaces the internal promoter elements conserved in 5S rRNA. The discrete typing unit IIb Esmeraldo strain contains approximately 135 repeats and shows a region of homology to the array invader in the 50 ﬂank of the array, but no evidence of the invading sequence element within the array. A survey of additional discrete typing unit IIb strains revealed a split within the subgroup, in which some strains contained invaded arrays and others were homogeneous for the 5S rRNA. The putative discrete typing unit IIb ancestor of the hybrid discrete typing units IId and IIe more closely resembles the extant Bolivian/Chilean IIb isolates than the Brazilian IIb isolates based on the correlation with the array invader.},

Both species have a diploid number 2n = 36 with similar karyotypes and microsatellite distribution patterns but present contrasting C-positive heterochromatin and CMA3+ banding patterns. The remarkable interstitial series of C-positive heterochromatin occurring in L. melanoguttata is absent in L. bimaculata. Accordingly, L. bimaculata shows the ribosomal DNA sites as the only GC-rich (CMA3+) regions, while L. melanoguttata shows evidence of a clear intercalated CMA3+ banding pattern. In addition, the multiple 5S and 18S rDNA sites in L. melanogutatta contrast with single sites present in L. bimaculata. Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) experiments also revealed a high level of genomic diﬀerentiation between both species. A polymorphic state of a conspicuous C-positive, CMA3+, and (CGG)n band was found only to occur in L. bimaculata females, and its possible relationship with a nascent sex chromosome system is discussed. Whole chromosome painting (WCP) and CGH experiments indicate that the Lebiasina species examined and Boulengerella maculata share similar chromosomal sequences, thus supporting the relatedness between them and the evolutionary relationships between the Lebiasinidae and Ctenoluciidae families.},

In spite of their profuse use as molecular markers for a variety of genetic and evolutionary studies, their genomic location, distribution, and function are not yet well understood. Here we report the first thorough joint analysis of microsatellite motifs at both genomic and chromosomal levels in animal species, by a combination of 454 sequencing and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) techniques performed on two grasshopper species. The in silico analysis of the 454 reads suggested that microsatellite expansion is not driving size increase of these genomes, as SSR abundance was higher in the species showing the smallest genome. However, the two species showed the same uneven and nonrandom location of SSRs, with clear predominance of dinucleotide motifs and association with several types of repetitive elements, mostly histone gene spacers, ribosomal DNA intergenic spacers (IGS), and transposable elements (TEs). The FISH analysis showed a dispersed chromosome distribution of microsatellite motifs in euchromatic regions, in coincidence with chromosome location patterns previously observed for many mobile elements in these species. However, some SSR motifs were clustered, especially those located in the histone gene cluster.},

The mechanisms of the expansion process have been investigated intensely in E. coli, yeast, transgenic mice, mammalian cell culture, and in human clinical cases. Whereas studies from 1994–1999 have implicated DNA replication and repair at the paused synthesis sites due to the unusual conformations of the triplet repeat sequences, recent work has shown that homologous recombination (gene conversion) is a powerful mechanism for generating massive expansions, in addition to, or in concert with, replication and repair.},

	abstract = {Microsatellite DNA is highly polymorphic and informative, which makes its distribution pattern and its associations very valuable for marker applications and genomic research in evolution. Using computational and statistical approaches, based on database technology, we have demonstrated that microsatellite content is consistently and signiﬁcantly 2 to 5 fold lower than the average chromosomal level in the centromeric and pericentromeric regions of the chromosomes of two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa. We conducted a path coefﬁcient analysis to compare the direct effect of microsatellites (from mono-nucleotide through to penta-nucleotide repeats) on recombination rates. The results revealed that tri- and pentanucleotide microsatellites signiﬁcantly inﬂuence recombination rates. In the human genome, tri-, tetra- and mono-nucleotide microsatellites, in decreasing order, make signiﬁcant direct contributions to recombination rates, according to DECODE, GENTHON, and MARSHFIELD averages. Path coefﬁcient analysis in rice and human genomes of the impact of di-nucleotide microsatellites of different motifs on recombination rates indicate that motifs with either A or T have an effect, resulting in increased recombination rates for microsatellites with motifs consisting of 50\% A or T, such as AG, TC, CA, TG. Conversely, microsatellites with motifs consisting of only A \& T or G \& C, such as AT, TA, GC or CG, have decreased recombination rates. The extremely low microsatellite content in centromeric and pericentromeric regions, as well as the quantitative association of microsatellite sequences with the recombination rate at the genome level, suggests that purifying selection in genome evolution creates a balance between genomic polymorphisms and the biological function of sequences in a genome.},

Attempts to generate GSH1 null mutants by gene disruption failed in Leishmania infantum. Removal of even a single allele invariably led to the generation of an extra copy of GSH1, maintaining two intact wild-type alleles. In the second and even third round of inactivation, the markers integrated at the homologous locus but always preserved two intact copies of GSH1. We probed into the mechanism of GSH1 duplication. GSH1 is subtelomeric on chromosome 18 and Southern blot analysis indicated that a 10-kb fragment flanked by 466-bp direct repeated sequences was duplicated in tandem on the same chromosomal allele each time GSH1 was targeted. Polymerase chain reaction analysis and sequencing confirmed the generation of novel junctions created at the level of the 466-bp repeats consequent to locus duplication. In loss of heterozygosity attempts, the same repeated sequences were utilized for generating extrachromosomal circular amplicons. Our results are consistent with break-induced replication as a mechanism for the generation of this regional polyploidy to compensate for the inactivation of an essential gene. This chromosomal repeat expansion through repeated sequences could be implicated in locus duplication in Leishmania.},

The Amaxa nucleofector device was systematically tested in the present study in order to improve the electroporation conditions in the epimastigote forms of T. cruzi. The transfection efﬁciency was quantiﬁed using the green ﬂuorescent protein (GFP) as reporter gene followed by cell survival assessment. The herein used nucleofection parameters have increased the survival rates (N 90\%) and the transfection efﬁciency by approximately 35\%. The small amount of epimastigotes and DNA required for the nucleofection can turn the method adopted here into an attractive tool for high throughput screening (HTS) applications, and for gene editing in parasites where genetic manipulation tools remain relatively scarce.},

Therefore, understanding the mechanisms used by Leishmania parasites to survive under drug pressure is essential, particularly for species of medical-veterinary importance such as L. amazonensis.
Methods:  Here, we used RNA-seq technology to analyse transcriptome profiles and identify global changes in gene expression between antimony-resistant and -sensitive L. amazonensis promastigotes.
Results:  A total of 723 differentially expressed genes were identified between resistant and sensitive lines. Comparative transcriptomic analysis revealed that genes encoding proteins involved in metabolism (fatty acids) and stress response, as well as those associated with antimony resistance in other Leishmania species, were upregulated in the antimony-resistant line. Most importantly, we observed upregulation of genes encoding autophagy proteins, suggesting that in the presence of trivalent stibogluconate ­(SbIII) L. amazonensis can activate these genes either as a survival strategy or to induce cell death, as has been observed in other parasites.
Conclusions:  This work identified global transcriptomic changes in an in vitro-adapted strain in response to S­ bIII. Our results provide relevant information to continue understanding the mechanism used by parasites of the subgenus Leishmania (L. amazonensis) to generate an antimony-resistant phenotype.},

	abstract = {Increasing drug resistance towards ﬁrst line antimony-derived compounds has forced the introduction of novel therapies in leishmaniasis endemic areas including amphotericin B and miltefosine. However, their use is threatened by the emergence and spread of drug-resistant strains. In order to discover stage-dependent resistance genes, we have adapted the Cos-Seq approach through the introduction of macrophage infections in the pipeline. A L. infantum intracellular amastigote population complemented with a L. infantum cosmid library was submitted to increasing concentrations of miltefosine, amphotericin B and pentavalent antimonials in experimental infections of THP-1 cells. For each step of selection, amastigotes were extracted and cosmids were isolated and submitted to next-generation sequencing, followed by subsequent gene-enrichment analyses. Cos-Seq screen in amastigotes revealed four highly enriched loci for antimony, ﬁve for miltefosine and one for amphotericin B. Of these, a total of seven cosmids were recovered and tested for resistance in both promastigotes and amastigotes. Candidate genes within the pinpointed genomic regions were validated using single gene overexpression in wildtype parasites and/or gene disruption by means of a CRISPR-Cas9-based approach. This led to the identiﬁcation and validation of a stage-independent antimony-resistance gene (LinJ.06.1010) coding for a putative leucine rich repeat protein and a novel amastigote-speciﬁc miltefosine-resistance gene (LinJ.32.0050) coding for a member of the SEC13 family of WD-repeat proteins. This study further reinforces the power of Cos-Seq approach to discover novel drug-resistance genes, some of which are life-stages speciﬁc.},

	abstract = {The polyamine biosynthetic pathway of protozoan parasites has been validated as a target in antiparasitic chemotherapy. To investigate this pathway at the biochemical and genetic level in a model parasite, the gene encoding spermidine synthase (SPDSYN), a key polyamine biosynthetic enzyme, has been cloned and sequenced from Leishmania dono6ani. The L. dono6ani SPDSYN gene encodes a polypeptide of 300 amino acids that exhibits 56\% amino acid identity with the human counterpart. SPDSYN is present as a single copy gene in the leishmanial genome and encodes a 1.6 kb transcript. Employing SPDSYN ﬂanking sequences to construct drug resistance cassettes, a Dspdsyn knockout strain of L. dono6ani was created by double targeted gene replacement. This Dspdsyn line could not convert putrescine to spermidine and was auxotrophic for polyamines. The polyamine auxotrophy could be circumvented by exogenous spermidine but not by putrescine (1,4-diaminobutane), cadaverine (1,5-diaminopentane), 1,3-diaminopropane, or spermine. Incubation of the null mutant in polyamine-deﬁcient medium resulted in a rapid depletion in the intracellular spermidine level with a concomitant elevation of the putrescine pool. In addition, the level of trypanothione, a spermidine-containing thiol, was reduced, whereas the glutathione pool increased 3 – 4-fold. These data establish that SPDSYN is an essential enzyme in L. dono6ani promastigotes. The molecular and cellular reagents created in this investigation provide a foundation for subsequent structure-function and inhibitor design studies on this key polyamine biosynthetic enzyme. © 2001 Elsevier Science B.V.

	abstract = {It was recently hypothesized that Leishmania amastigotes could constitute a semi-quiescent stage characterized by low replication and reduced metabolic activity. This concept developed with Leishmania (Leishmania) mexicana and Leishmania (Leishmania) major models might explain numerous clinical and sub-clinical features of Leishmania (Viannia) braziliensis infections, like reactivation of the disease, non-response to chemotherapy or asymptomatic infections. We compared here in vitro the proliferative capability of L. (V.) braziliensis amastigotes and promastigotes, assessed the expression of key molecular parameters and performed metabolomic analysis. We found that contrary to the highly proliferative promastigotes, amastigotes (axenic and intracellular) do not show evidence of extensive proliferation. In parallel, amastigotes showed a significant decrease of (i) the kDNA mini-circle abundance, (ii) the intracellular ATP level, (iii) the ribosomal components: rRNA subunits 18S and 28S α and ribosomal proteins RPS15 and RPL19, (iv) total RNA and protein levels. An untargeted metabolomic study identified clear differences between the different life stages: in comparison to logarithmic promastigotes, axenic amastigotes showed (a) a strong decrease of 14 essential and non-essential amino acids and eight metabolites involved in polyamine synthesis, (b) extensive changes in the phospholipids composition and (c) increased levels of several endogenous and exogenous sterols. Altogether, our results show that L. (V.) braziliensis amastigotes can show a phenotype with negligible rate of proliferation, a lower capacity of biosynthesis, a reduced bio-energetic level and a strongly altered metabolism. Our results pave the way for further exploration of quiescence among amastigotes of this species.},

	abstract = {Background: Visceral leishmaniasis has now emerged as an important opportunistic disease in patients coinfected with human immunodeficiency virus type-1 (HIV-1). Although the effectiveness of HIV-1 protease inhibitors, such as nelfinavir, in antiretroviral therapies is well documented, little is known of the impact of these drugs on Leishmania in coinfected individuals.
Methodology and Principal Findings: Here, we show that nelfinavir generates oxidative stress in the parasite, leading to altered physiological parameters such as an increase in the sub-G1 DNA content, nuclear DNA fragmentation and loss of mitochondrial potential, which are all characteristics of apoptosis. Pretreatment of axenic amastigotes with the caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk did not inhibit the increase in sub-G1 DNA content in nelfinavir-treated parasites, suggesting therefore that this antiviral agent does not kill Leishmania amastigotes in a caspase-dependent manner. Furthermore, we observed that the mitochondrial resident protein endonuclease G is involved. We also demonstrate that parasites overexpressing GSH1 (the rate limiting enzyme of glutathione biosynthesis) were more resistant to nelfinavir when compared to untransfected controls.
Conclusions and Significance: These data suggest that nelfinavir induces oxidative stress in Leishmania amastigotes, culminating in caspase-independent apoptosis, in which DNA is degraded by endonuclease G. This study provides a rationale for future, long-term design of new therapeutic strategies to test nelfinavir as a potential antileishmanial agent as well as for possible future use in Leishmania/HIV-1 coinfections.},

It is a pathogen found worldwide that affects domestic cats and is associated with a variety of morbid conditions, such as gingivitis, stomatitis, recurrent secondary infections and B cell Iymphomas. The hallmark of the infection is a gradual depletion of C04+ helper T lymphocytes. Since the FIV was first isolated, research efforts have focussed on understanding the resulting infection, pathogenesis and clinical signs in domestic cats. Those studies are due to FIVs importance not only as a veterinary pathogen, but also as an animal infection model for the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and the related acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIOS). This article reviews the current state of knowledge about the FIV íntection.},

Thus, we hypothesized that enFeLV might inﬂuence the pathogenesis and outcome of FeLV infection. No signiﬁcant difference in the infection outcome (regressive versus progressive infection) was observed between groups of cats with high or low enFeLV loads following FeLV-A challenge. However, cats with high enFeLV loads showed higher viral replication (plasma viral RNA and p27 antigen levels) than cats with low enFeLV loads in the early phase of the infection. The enFeLV transcription level varied at different time points, but no clear-cut pattern was observed. In conclusion, our results demonstrated an association between enFeLV loads and FeLV replication but not outcome of infection. enFeLV should be considered as an important confounder in experimental FeLV infection or vaccination studies.},

However, transcription and translation of enFeLV have been demonstrated in tissues of healthy cats and in feline cell lines. The presence of enFeLV-env has been shown in speciﬁc embryonic tissues and adult thymic cells. In addition, the enFeLV-env region recombines with FeLV subgroup A giving rise to an infectious FeLV-B virus. enFeLV envelope protein, FeLIX (FeLV infectivity X-essory protein) is also involved in mediating FeLV-T infection. In order to test the hypothesis that the enFeLV loads play a role in exogenous FeLV-A infection and pathogenesis, quantitative real-time PCR and RT-PCR assays were developed. An assay, speciﬁc to U3 region of all different subtypes of exogenous FeLV, was designed and applied to quantify exogenous FeLV proviral or viral load in cats, while three real-time PCR assays were designed to quantify U3 and env enFeLV loads (two within U3 amplifying different sequences; one within env). enFeLV loads were investigated in blood samples derived from Swiss privately owned domestic cats, speciﬁc pathogen-free (SPF) cats and European wildcats (Felis silvestris silvestris). Signiﬁcant differences in enFeLV loads were observed between privately owned cats and SPF cats as well as among SPF cats originating from different catteries and among domestic cats of different breeds. When privately owned cats were compared, FeLV-infected cats had higher loads than uninfected cats. In addition, wildcats had higher enFeLV loads than domestic cats. In conclusion, the quantitative realtime PCR assays described herein are important prerequisites to quantify enFeLV proviral loads in felids and thus are important tools to investigate the role of enFeLV loads in FeLV infection.},

	abstract = {Full length endogenous feline leukemia virus (FeLV) proviruses exist within the genomes of many breeds of domestic cat raising the possibility that they may also exist in a transmissible exogenous form. Such viruses would share receptor usage with the recombinant FeLV-B subgroup, a viral subgroup that arises in vivo by recombination between exogenous subgroup A virus (FeLV-A) and endogenous FeLV. Accordingly, all isolates of FeLV-B made to date have contained a “helper” FeLV-A, consistent with their recombinatorial origin. In order to assess whether endogenous viruses are transmitted between cats, we examined primary isolates of FeLV for which the viral subgroup had been determined for the presence of a subgroup B virus that lacked an FeLV-A. Here we describe the identiﬁcation of two primary ﬁeld isolates of FeLV (2518 and 4314) that appeared to contain subgroup B virus only by classical interference assays, raising the possibility of between-host transmission of endogenous FeLV. Sequencing of the env gene and U3 region of the 3 long terminal repeat (LTR) conﬁrmed that both viral genomes contained endogenous viral env genes. However the viral 3 LTRs appeared exogenous in origin with a putative 3 recombination breakpoint residing at the 3 end of the env gene. Further, the FeLV-2518 virions also co-packaged a truncated FeLV-A genome containing a defective env gene, termed FeLV-2518(A) whilst no helper subgroup A viral genome was detected in virions of FeLV-4314. The acquisition of an exogenous LTR by the endogenous FeLV in 4314 may have allowed a recombinant FeLV variant to outgrow an exogenous FeLV-A virus that was presumably present during ﬁrst infection. Given time, a similar evolution may also occur within the 2518 isolate. The data suggest that endogenous FeLVs may be mobilised by acquisition of exogenous LTRs yielding novel viruses that type biologically as FeLV-B.},

In this study, polymerase chain reaction and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay were used to test 198 blood samples from stray cats from Harbin, China, for FIV infection, FeLV seropositivity, and the prevalent subtypes of FIV. The gag capsid amino terminus and env V3–V5 regions of FIV samples were used to perform phylogenetic analysis. In total, 3\% (6/198) of the stray cats from five districts of Harbin was PCR- were ELISA-positive for FIV. The FeLV positivity rate was 1\% (2/198). Phylogenetic analysis of the gag and env sequences showed that cats were infected with FIV subtype A. This is the first study examining the prevalence rates of FIV and FeLV and the prevalent subtypes of FIV of stray cats in Harbin.

	abstract = {Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) occurs in nature not as a single genomic species but as a family of closely related viruses. The disease outcome of natural FeLV infection is variable and likely reﬂects genetic variation both in the virus and the naturally outbreeding host population. A series of studies have been undertaken with the objectives of examining natural FeLV genetic variation, the selective pressures operative in FeLV infection that lead to predominance of natural variants, and the consequences for infection and disease progression. Genetic variation among FeLV isolates was examined in a cohort of naturally infected cats with thymic lymphoma of T-cell origin, non-T-cell multicentric lymphoma, myeloproliferative disorder or anemia. The predominant isolate in the cohort, designated FeLV-945, was identiﬁed exclusively in disorders of non-T-cell origin. The FeLV-945 LTR was shown to contain a unique 21-bp repeat element, triplicated in tandem downstream of enhancer. The 21-bp triplication was shown to act as a transcriptional enhancer and to confer a replicative advantage through the assembly of a distinctive transcription factor complex. Oncogene utilization during tumor induction by FeLV-945 was studied using a recombinant Moloney murine leukemia virus containing the FeLV-945 LTR. This approach identiﬁed novel loci of common proviral integration in tumors, including the regulatory subunit of PI-3Kgamma. Mutational changes identiﬁed in FeLV-945 SU were shown not to alter receptor usage as measured by host range and superinfection interference, but to signiﬁcantly increase the efﬁciency of receptor binding. To determine whether the unique sequence elements of FeLV-945 inﬂuence the course of infection and disease in vivo, recombinant viruses were constructed in which the FeLV-945 LTR alone, or the FeLV-945 SU gene and LTR were substituted into the prototype isolate FeLV-A/61E. Longitudinal studies of infected animals showed that substitution of the FeLV-945 LTR into FeLV-A/61E resulted in a signiﬁcantly more rapid disease onset, but did not alter the tumorigenic spectrum. In contrast, substitution of both the FeLV-945 LTR and SU gene changed the disease outcome entirely. Together, these observations indicate that the distinctive LTR and SU gene of FeLV-945 mediate a rapid pathogenesis with distinctive clinical features and oncogenic mechanisms.},

In domestic cats FIV infection is a valuable small animal model for HIV infection. In recent years there has been a significant increase in interest in FIV, in part to exploit this, but also because of the potential it has as a human gene therapy vector. Though much less studied than HIV there are many parallels in the replication of the two viruses, but also important differences and, despite their likely common origin, the viruses have in some cases used alternative strategies to overcome similar problems. Recent advances in understanding the structure and function of FIV RNA and proteins and their interactions has enhanced our knowledge of FIV replication significantly, however, there are still many gaps.

Such recombinant FeLVs, designated FeLV-subgroup B or FeLVsubgroup D, can be generated by transduced endogenous retroviral env sequences encoding the viral envelope. These recombinant viruses have biologically distinct properties and may mediate different disease outcomes. The generation of such recombinant viruses resulted in structural diversity of the FeLV particle and genetic diversity of the virus itself. FeLV env diversity through mutation and recombination has been studied, while gag diversity and its possible effects are less well understood. In this study, we investigated recombination events in the gag genes of FeLVs isolated from naturally infected cats and reference isolates. Recombination and phylogenetic analyses indicated that the gag genes often contain endogenous FeLV sequences and were occasionally replaced by entire endogenous FeLV gag genes. Phylogenetic reconstructions of FeLV gag sequences allowed for classiﬁcation into three distinct clusters, similar to those previously established for the env gene. Analysis of the recombination junctions in FeLV gag indicated that these variants have similar recombination patterns within the same genotypes, indicating that the recombinant viruses were horizontally transmitted among cats. It remains to be investigated whether the recombinant sequences affect the molecular mechanism of FeLV transmission.

The molecular basis of this persistence is the integration of a copy of the viral genome into cellular chromosomal DNA. At the level of the whole animal, however, each retrovirus genus has evolved a different strategy to ensure its survival. This variety is well illustrated in the cat. Feline leukaemia virus, an oncovirus, has a simple genomic structure and survives in its host by suppressing the immune response to the virus. As a result, this virus is antigenically highly conserved. By contrast, feline immunodeficiency virus and feline foamy virus, representatives of the lentiviruses and spumaviruses, respectively, have more complex genomes which include genes responsible for maintaining the virus in a latent state thereby avoiding elimination in the face of a powerful antiviral immune response. In the lentiviruses, this response drives the selection of viruses exhibiting variation in antigenicity and pathogenicity. \# 1999 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

Using these restriction enzymes, FIV isolates belonging to subtypes A, B and D, which had been classiﬁed on the basis of the en6 gene V3–V5 sequence, could be discriminated. Genetic subtypes of FIV prevalent in Japan were investigated using the gag-nested PCR-RFLP analysis. Of 88 FIV-infected cats, PCR products of 70 cats showed a subtype B RFLP pattern (digestion only with P6uII), those of nine cats had a subtype D RFLP pattern (digestion only with BamHI), and those of seven cats had a subtype A RFLP pattern (digestion only with HindIII). The PCR products of the remaining two cats had subtype A and B RFLP patterns (digestion with both HindIII and P6uII). The digestion pattern of the gag-nested PCR-RFLP analysis was unchanged after in vivo passages of the virus.

FeLV-induced neoplasms are caused, at least in part, by somatically acquired insertional mutagenesis in which the integrated provirus may activate a proto-oncogene or disrupt a tumor suppressor gene. The common integration sites for FeLV have been identiﬁed in six loci with feline lymphomas: c-myc, ﬂvi-1, ﬂvi-2 (contains bmi-1), ﬁt-1, pim-1 and ﬂit-1. Oncogenic association of the loci includes that c-myc is known as a proto-oncogene, bmi-1 and pim-1 have been recognized as myc-collaborators, ﬁt-1 appears to be closely linked to myb, and ﬂit-1 insertion is shown to be associated with overexpression of a cellular gene, e.g. ACVRL1. Thus, identiﬁcation of common integration sites for FeLV is a tenable model to clarify oncogenesis. Recent advances in molecular biology and cytogenetics have developed to rapidly detect numbers of retroviral integration sites by genome-wide large-scale analyses. Especially, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based strategies and chromosome analyses with ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) will be applicable for studies on FeLV.},

To understand the subtype diversity of FIV in Portugal a serological survey was conducted during 1 year in the Veterinary Faculty Hospital, Lisbon, Portugal to identify seropositive animals. Two viral genomic regions were ampliﬁed by a nested PCR, sequenced and the phylogenetic relationships between 24 new Portuguese FIV sequences and other previously published FIV isolates were assessed. The introduction of these sequences induced a subclustering in subtype B including most of the new Portuguese sequences. Moreover, a new cluster emerged, with two highly divergent new sequences that might represent a new subtype. The study of these new FIV isolates showed the presence in Portugal of a unique viral population subclustering within subtype B and of sequences clearly divergent from the ﬁve known subtypes, providing a contribution for the understanding of FIV’s genetic diversity.},

Here, we deﬁne an FIV tier system using two related FIV dual-subtype (A + D) vaccines: the commercially available inactivated infected-cell vaccine (Fel-O-Vax® FIV) and its prototype vaccine solely composed of inactivated whole viruses. Both vaccines afforded combined protection rates of 100\% against subtype-A tier-1 FIVPet, 89\% against subtype-B tier-3 FIVFC1, 61\% against recombinant subtypeA/B tier-2 FIVBang, 62\% against recombinant subtype-F /C tier-3 FIVNZ1, and 40\% against subtype-A tier-2 FIVUK8 in short-duration (37–41 weeks) studies. In long-duration (76–80 weeks) studies, the commercial vaccine afforded a combined protection rate of at least 46\% against the tier-2 and tier-3 viruses. Notably, protection rates observed here are far better than recently reported HIV-1 vaccine trials (Sanou et al., The Open AIDS J 2012; 6:246–60). Prototype vaccine protection against two tier-3 and one tier-2 viruses was more effective than commercial vaccine. Such protection did not correlate with the presence of vaccine-induced NAbs to challenge viruses. This is the ﬁrst large-scale (228 laboratory cats) study characterizing short- and long-duration efﬁcacies of dual-subtype FIV vaccines against heterologous subtype and recombinant viruses, as well as FIV tiers based on in vitro NAb analysis and in vivo passivetransfer studies. These studies demonstrate that not all vaccine protection is mediated by vaccine-induced NAbs.},

Recent studies using analyses with enhanced sensitivity have correlated loads throughout FeLV with the clinical outcome, though remarkably, during the acute phase of infection, proviral and viral RNA burdens in the peripheral blood do not differ between groups. We hypothesized that viral loads in speciﬁc leukocyte subsets inﬂuence the infection outcome. Using a method established to determine the proviral and cell-associated viral RNA loads in speciﬁc leukocyte subsets, we evaluated viral loads in eleven FeLVexposed speciﬁc pathogen-free (SPF) cats 2.5 years post-infection. Six cats had undergone regressive infection whereas ﬁve were persistently viremic. Aviremic cats had lower total proviral blood loads than the persistently infected cats and FeLV proviral DNA was shown to be integrated into genomic DNA in four out of four animals. Lymphocytes were predominantly infected vs. moncytes and granulocytes in aviremic cats. In contrast, persistently viremic cats were provirus-positive in all leukocyte subsets. The acute phase kinetics of FeLV infection were analyzed in two additional cats; an early lymphoreticular phase with productive infection in lymphocytes in both cats and in monocytes in one cat was followed by infection of the granulocytes; both cats became persistently infected. These results indicate that FeLV persistent viremia is associated with secondary viremia of bone marrow origin, whereas regressive cats only sustain a non-productive infection in low numbers of lymphocytes.},

Efﬁcacious FeLV vaccines prevent persistent viremia and development of FeLV-related disease after virus exposure, but not minimal viral replication and a provirus-positive state as recently demonstrated using sensitive real-time PCR assays. Proviral integration is an important parameter of latent infection and persistence of retroviruses in infected cells. So far, FeLV-speciﬁc real-time PCR assays could not distinguish between the integrated and episomal forms of the provirus. Thus, it was the aim of the present study to develop a rapid assay for the detection of FeLV proviral integration. The test combines conventional and quantitative real-time PCR that use virus-speciﬁc primers and primers speciﬁc for cat genomic small interspersed nuclear elements. It was applied to analyze the time course of proviral integration into the genome of a feline ﬁbroblast cell line and detect provirus integration in peripheral white blood cells from vaccinated and unvaccinated, FeLV-exposed cats. The newly developed rapid test will essentially contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of FeLV infection and be especially useful in the development of antiretroviral vaccines and therapies aimed at the inhibition of proviral integration.},

Research into the mechanisms of cellular transformation employed by FeLV and other oncogenic retroviruses has provided as much information on the regulation of eukaryotic cell growth and differentiation as it has about cancer. The recognition that a cancer has a viral cause opens up the possibility of novel treatments that spare the host from cytotoxic side-effects by speciﬁcally targeting the virus, or the host’s immune response to it. The ultimate prize for viral-associated cancers is their prevention. Vaccination and changes in management practices have seen the global prevalence of FeLV infection fall and, with it, the incidence of FeLV-related cancers. Remarkably, in the face of this success, the prevalence of feline lymphoma remains high. At least one other virus, the lentivirus feline immunodeﬁciency virus (FIV), accounts for some of these cases. Transformation by FIV involves incompletely understood mechanisms that are distinct from those employed by FeLV. This review will focus on the current understanding of FeLVassociated and FIV-associated lymphoma and consider whether yet more viral aetiologies could be waiting to be discovered.},

Malaysian FeLV isolates are found to be highly similar with a homology of 91\% to 100\%. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that Malaysian FeLV isolates divided into two clusters, with a majority (86.2\%) sharing similarity with FeLV-K01803 and fewer isolates (13.8\%) with FeLV-GM1 strain. Different enhancer motifs including NF-GMa, Krox-20/WT1I-del2, BAF1, AP-2, TBP, TFIIF-beta, TRF, and TFIID are found to occur either in single, duplicate, triplicate, or sets of 5 in different positions within the U3-LTR-gag region.

Malaysian FeLV isolates are highly similar, and a majority of them are closely related to a UK isolate. This study provides the first molecular based information on FeLV in Malaysia.

	abstract = {Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) comprise a significant percentage of the mammalian genome, and it is poorly understood whether they will remain as inactive genomes or emerge as infectious retroviruses. Although several types of ERVs are present in domestic cats, infectious ERVs have not been demonstrated. Here, we report a previously uncharacterized class of endogenous gammaretroviruses, termed ERV-DCs, that is present and hereditary in the domestic cat genome. We have characterized a subset of ERV-DC proviral clones, which are numbered according to their genomic insertions. One of these, ERV-DC10, located in the q12-q21 region on chromosome C1, is an infectious gammaretrovirus capable of infecting a broad range of cells, including human. Our studies indicate that ERV-DC10 entered the genome of domestic cats in the recent past and appeared to translocate to or reintegrate at a distinct locus as infectious ERV-DC18. Insertional polymorphism analysis revealed that 92 of 244 domestic cats had ERV-DC10 on a homozygous or heterozygous locus. ERV-DC-like sequences were found in primate and rodent genomes, suggesting that these ERVs, and recombinant viruses such as RD-114 and BaEV, originated from an ancestor of ERV-DC. We also found that a novel recombinant virus, feline leukemia virus subgroup D (FeLV-D), was generated by ERV-DC
              env
              transduction into feline leukemia virus in domestic cats. Our results indicate that ERV-DCs behave as donors and/or acceptors in the generation of infectious, recombinant viruses. The presence of such infectious endogenous retroviruses, which could be harmful or beneficial to the host, may affect veterinary medicine and public health.},

Thus far, the detailed classifications for all viruses are neither complete nor free from dispute. For example, the current missing label rates in GenBank are 12.1\% for family label and 30.0\% for genus label. Using the proposed Natural Vector representation, all 2,044 single-segment referenced viral genomes in GenBank can be embedded in R12. Unlike other approaches, this allows us to determine phylogenetic relations for all viruses at any level (e.g., Baltimore class, family, subfamily, genus, and species) in real time. Additionally, the proposed graphical representation for virus phylogeny provides a visualization of the distribution of viruses in R12. Unlike the commonly used tree visualization methods which suffer from uniqueness and existence problems, our representation always exists and is unique. This approach is successfully used to predict and correct viral classification information, as well as to identify viral origins; e.g. a recent public health threat, the West Nile virus, is closer to the Japanese encephalitis antigenic complex based on our visualization. Based on crossvalidation results, the accuracy rates of our predictions are as high as 98.2\% for Baltimore class labels, 96.6\% for family labels, 99.7\% for subfamily labels and 97.2\% for genus labels.},

	abstract = {Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) belongs to the genus Gammaretrovirus, and causes a variety of neoplastic and non-neoplastic diseases in cats. Alteration of viral env sequences is thought to be associated with disease specificity, but the way in which genetic diversity of FeLV contributes to the generation of such variants in nature is poorly understood. We isolated FeLV env genes from naturally infected cats in Japan and analyzed the evolutionary dynamics of these genes. Phylogenetic reconstructions separated our FeLV samples into three distinct genetic clusters, termed Genotypes I, II, and III. Genotype I is a major genetic cluster and can be further classified into Clades 1–7 in Japan. Genotypes were correlated with geographical distribution; Genotypes I and II were distributed within Japan, whilst FeLV samples from outside Japan belonged to Genotype III. These results may be due to geographical isolation of FeLVs in Japan. The observed structural diversity of the FeLV env gene appears to be caused primarily by mutation, deletion, insertion and recombination, and these variants may be generated de novo in individual cats. FeLV interference assay revealed that FeLV genotypes did not correlate with known FeLV receptor subgroups. We have identified the genotypes which we consider to be reliable for evaluating phylogenetic relationships of FeLV, which embrace the high structural diversity observed in our sample. Overall, these findings extend our understanding of Gammaretrovirus evolutionary patterns in the field, and may provide a useful basis for assessing the emergence of novel strains and understanding the molecular mechanisms of FeLV transmission in cats.},

	abstract = {FIV/HIV infections are associated with an early robust humoral and cellular anti-viral immune response followed by a progressive immune suppression that eventually results in AIDS. Several mechanisms responsible for this immune dysfunction have been proposed including cytokine dysregulation, immunologic anergy and apoptosis, and inappropriate activation of immune regulatory cells. Studies on FIV infection provide evidence for all three. Cytokine alterations include decreases in IL2 and IL12 production and increases in IFNγ and IL10 in FIV+ cats compared to normal cats. The elevated IL10:IL12 ratio is associated with the inability of FIV+ cats to mount a successful immune response to secondary pathogens. Additionally, chronic antigenic (FIV) stimulation results in an increase in the percent of activated T cells expressing B7 and CTLA4 costimulatory molecules in infected cats. The expression of these molecules is associated with T cells that are undergoing apoptosis in the lymph nodes. As ligation of CTLA4 by B7 transduces a signal for induction of anergy, one can speculate that the activated T cells are capable of T cell-T cell interactions resulting in anergy and apoptosis. The inability of CD4+ cells from FIV+ cats to produce IL2 in response to recall antigens and the gradual loss of CD4+ cell numbers could be due to B7CTLA4 interactions. The chronic antigenemia may also lead to activation of CD4+CD25+ T regulatory cells. Treg cells from FIV+ cats are chronically activated and inhibit the mitogen-induced proliferative response of CD4+CD25− by down-regulating IL2 production. Although Treg cell activation can be antigen specific, the suppressor function is not, and thus activated Treg cells would suppress responses to secondary pathogens as well as to FIV. Concomitant with the well known virus-induced immune suppression is a progressive immune hyper-activation. Evidence for immune hyper-activation includes polyclonal B cell responses, gradual replacement of naïve CD4+ and CD8+ T cell phenotypes with activation phenotypes (CD62L−, B7+, CTLA4+), and the chronic activation of CD4+CD25+ Treg cells. Thus lentivirus infections lead to severe immune dysregulation manifested as both chronic immune suppression and chronic immune activation. FIV infection of cats provides a number of advantages over other lentivirus infections as a model to study this immune dysregulation. It is a natural infection that has existed in balance with the cat’s immune system for thousands of years. As such, the natural history and pathogenesis provides an excellent model to study the long term relationships between AIDS lentivirus and host immune system function/ dysregulation.},

	abstract = {Background: Phylogenetic analyses are an essential part in the exploratory assessment of nucleic acid and amino acid sequences. Particularly in virology, they are able to delineate the evolution and epidemiology of disease etiologic agents and/or the evolutionary path of their hosts. The objective of this review is to help researchers who want to use phylogenetic analyses as a tool in virology and molecular epidemiology studies, presenting the most commonly used methodologies, describing the importance of the different techniques, their peculiar vocabulary and some examples of their use in virology. Review: This article starts presenting basic concepts of molecular epidemiology and molecular evolution, emphasizing their relevance in the context of viral infectious diseases. It presents a session on the vocabulary relevant to the subject, bringing readers to a minimum level of knowledge needed throughout this literature review. Within its main subject, the text explains what a molecular phylogenetic analysis is, starting from a multiple alignment of nucleotide or amino acid sequences. The different software used to perform multiple alignments may apply different algorithms. To build a phylogeny based on amino acid or nucleotide sequences it is necessary to produce a data matrix based on a model for nucleotide or amino acid replacement, also called evolutionary model. There are a number of evolutionary models available, varying in complexity according to the number of parameters (transition, transversion, GC content, nucleotide position in the codon, among others). Some papers presented herein provide techniques that can be used to choose evolutionary models. After the model is chosen, the next step is to opt for a phylogenetic reconstruction method that best fits the available data and the selected model. Here we present the most common reconstruction methods currently used, describing their principles, advantages and disadvantages. Distance methods, for example, are simpler and faster, however, they do not provide reliable estimations when the sequences are highly divergent. The accuracy of the analysis with probabilistic models (neighbour joining, maximum likelihood and bayesian inference) strongly depends on the adherence of the actual data to the chosen development model. Finally, we also explore topology confidence tests, especially the most used one, the bootstrap. To assist the reader, this review presents figures to explain specific situations discussed in the text and numerous examples of previously published scientific articles in virology that demonstrate the importance of the techniques discussed herein, as well as their judicious use.},

	abstract = {Endogenous retroviral sequences provide a molecular fossil record of ancient infections whose analysis might illuminate mechanisms of viral extinction. A close relative of gammaretroviruses, HERV-T, circulated in primates for {\textasciitilde}25 million years (MY) before apparent extinction within the past {\textasciitilde}8 MY. Construction of a near-complete catalog of HERV-T fossils in primate genomes allowed us to estimate a {\textasciitilde}32 MY old ancestral sequence and reconstruct a functional envelope protein (ancHTenv) that could support infection of a pseudotyped modern gammaretrovirus. Using ancHTenv, we identify monocarboxylate transporter-1 (MCT-1) as a receptor used by HERV-T for attachment and infection. A single HERV-T provirus in hominid genomes includes an env gene (hsaHTenv) that has been uniquely preserved. This apparently exapted HERV-T env could not support virion infection but could block ancHTenv mediated infection, by causing MCT-1 depletion from cell surfaces. Thus, hsaHTenv may have contributed to HERV-T extinction, and could also potentially regulate cellular metabolism.
          , 
            Over millions of years, viruses and the animals that they infect have been locked in a battle for survival, where each has needed to evolve ways to counteract the effects of the other. While the evolution of ancient animals can be studied by looking at the fossilized remains of their extinct relatives, studying how ancient viruses have evolved is more difficult as they usually do not leave behind physical traces of their existence. However, a family of viruses called retroviruses is a notable exception to this rule.
            Retroviruses have a step in their life cycle in which their genetic material is integrated into the genome (the name for an organism’s complete set of genetic material) of the cell that they have infected. In rare cases, when that cell is a precursor of a sperm or egg cell, then the viral genes may then be passed on to the animal’s offspring, ultimately leaving genetic traces that can be studied in modern animals. This acts as a genetic ‘fossil record’ of extinct viruses.
            HERV-T was a retrovirus that spread among our primate ancestors for about 25 million years before its extinction roughly 11 million years ago. Blanco-Melo et al. have now analyzed the genetic remains left by HERV-T in the genomes of humans and related primates, and were able to use this information to recreate a protein that made up the outer envelope that surrounded the virus. Further experiments showed that this viral protein helped HERV-T to infect human cells by interacting with a protein called MCT1 on the cell surface.
            Blanco-Melo et al. also found a particular HERV-T gene that was unexpectedly well preserved in the human genome. The gene retained its ability to produce an envelope protein for about 13 to 19 million years. It is likely that ancient primates ‘hijacked’ the viral gene and used the protein it produced to remove the MCT1 protein from the surface of their own cells. Without MCT1 on the surface, HERV-T was unable to infect the cells. Thus, these findings present an example of how viruses themselves can provide the genetic material that animals use to combat them, potentially leading to their extinction.},

	abstract = {Background: Endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) are genetic elements with a retroviral origin that are integrated into vertebrate genomes. In felids (Mammalia, Carnivora, Felidae), ERVs have been described mostly in the domestic cat, and only rarely in wild species. To gain insight into the origins and evolutionary dynamics of endogenous retroviruses in felids, we have identified and characterized partial pro/pol ERV sequences from eight Neotropical wild cat species, belonging to three distinct lineages of Felidae. We also compared them with publicly available genomic sequences of Felis catus and Panthera tigris, as well as with representatives of other vertebrate groups, and performed phylogenetic and molecular dating analyses to investigate the pattern and timing of diversification of these retroviral elements.
Results: We identified a high diversity of ERVs in the sampled felids, with a predominance of Gammaretrovirus-related sequences, including class I ERVs. Our data indicate that the identified ERVs arose from at least eleven horizontal interordinal transmissions from other mammals. Furthermore, we estimated that the majority of the Gamma-like integrations took place during the diversification of modern felids. Finally, our phylogenetic analyses indicate the presence of a genetically divergent group of sequences whose position in our phylogenetic tree was difficult to establish confidently relative to known retroviruses, and another lineage identified as ERVs belonging to class II.
Conclusions: Retroviruses have circulated in felids along with their evolution. The majority of the deep clades of ERVs exist since the primary divergence of felids’ base and cluster with retroviruses of divergent mammalian lineages, suggesting horizontal interordinal transmission. Our findings highlight the importance of additional studies on the role of ERVs in the genome landscaping of other carnivore species.},

	abstract = {Recombination events induce signiﬁcant genetic changes, and this process can result in virus genetic diversity or in the generation of novel pathogenicity. We discovered a new recombinant feline leukemia virus (FeLV) gag gene harboring an unrelated insertion, termed the X region, which was derived from Felis catus endogenous gammaretrovirus 4 (FcERV-gamma4). The identiﬁed FcERV-gamma4 proviruses have lost their coding capabilities, but some can express their viral RNA in feline tissues. Although the X-region-carrying recombinant FeLVs appeared to be replication-defective viruses, they were detected in 6.4\% of tested FeLV-infected cats. All isolated recombinant FeLV clones commonly incorporated a middle part of the FcERV-gamma4 5=-leader region as an X region. Surprisingly, a sequence corresponding to the portion contained in all X regions is also present in at least 13 endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) observed in the cat, human, primate, and pig genomes. We termed this shared genetic feature the commonly shared (CS) sequence. Despite our phylogenetic analysis indicating that all CS-sequence-carrying ERVs are classiﬁed as gammaretroviruses, no obvious closeness was revealed among these ERVs. However, the Shannon entropy in the CS sequence was lower than that in other parts of the provirus genome. Notably, the CS sequence of human endogenous retrovirus T had 73.8\% similarity with that of FcERV-gamma4, and speciﬁc signals were detected in the human genome by Southern blot analysis using a probe for the FcERV-gamma4 CS sequence. Our results provide an interesting evolutionary history for CS-sequence circulation among several distinct ancestral viruses and a novel recombined virus over a prolonged period.},

	abstract = {Background: Satellite DNA sequences are the most abundant components of heterochromatin and are repeated in tandem hundreds to thousands of times in the genome. However, the number of repeats of a specific satellite family can vary even between the genomes of related species or populations. The PcP190 satellite DNA family was identified in the genome of the leptodactylid frog Physalaemus cuvieri, which showed to be derived most likely from the 5S rDNA in an ancestral species. In this study, we investigate the presence of the PcP190 satellite DNA in several P. cuvieri populations and in four closely related species at the chromosomal and molecular level. Furthermore, we investigate the occurrence of this satellite DNA in the genomes of P. marmoratus as well as in representative species of the leptodactylid genus Leptodactylus (L. latrans) and the hylodid family (Crossodactylus gaudichaudii), all with the aim of investigating if the PcP190 satellite DNA presents or not a restricted distribution.
Results: The PcP190 satellite DNA was detected in all the analyzed species. Some of them exhibited particular sequence differences, allowing the identification of species-specific groups of sequences, but in other species, the sequences were more conserved. However, in a general analysis, conserved and variable domains have been recognized within the PcP190 monomer. The chromosomal analysis performed on P. cuvieri populations and closely related species revealed high variability of the satellite DNA amount and its chromosomal location, which has always been coincident with regions of centromeric/pericentromeric heterochromatin.
Conclusion: The PcP190 satellite DNA was found in representatives of two families, Leptodactylidae and Hylodidae, indicating that these sequences are widely distributed and conserved in these frogs. There is a pattern of non-random variation within the repeating units, indicating interplay between stochastic events and selective pressure along the PcP190 sequences. Karyotypic differences involving the PcP190 satellite DNA prove to be highly dynamic on the chromosomes of the Physalaemus and its differential accumulation has contributed to the differentiation process of the Z and W sex chromosomes in P. ephippifer.},

	abstract = {The paradoxical frog Pseudis tocantins is the only species in the Hylidae family with known heteromorphic Z and W sex chromosomes. The Z chromosome is metacentric and presents an interstitial nucleolar organizer region (NOR) on the long arm that is adjacent to a pericentromeric heterochromatic band. In contrast, the submetacentric W chromosome carries a pericentromeric NOR on the long arm, which is adjacent to a clearly evident heterochromatic band that is larger than the band found on the Z chromosome and justify the size difference observed between these chromosomes. Here, we provide evidence that the noncentromeric heterochromatic bands in Zq and Wq differ not only in size and location but also in composition, based on comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and an analysis of the anuran PcP190 satellite DNA. The finding of PcP190 sequences in P. tocantins extends the presence of this satellite DNA, which was previously detected among Leptodactylidae and Hylodidae, suggesting that this family of repetitive DNA is even older than it was formerly considered. Seven groups of PcP190 sequences were recognized in the genome of P. tocantins. PcP190 probes mapped to the heterochromatic band in Wq, and a Southern blot analysis indicated the accumulation of PcP190 in the female genome of P. tocantins, which suggests the involvement of this satellite DNA in the evolution of the sex chromosomes of this species.},

Moreover, two classes of NTS were detected in each species, characterized by base substitutions and insertions–deletions. Using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), two 5S rDNA chromosome loci that could be related to the two 5S rDNA NTS classes were observed in at least one of the species studied. 5S rDNA sequencing and chromosomal localization permitted the characterization of Brycon spp. and suggest a higher similarity among some of them.

The degree of conservation of transcriptional regulatory regions was analyzed in these lineages, revealing a conserved TATA-like box in the upstream region. The evolution of the 120 bp coding region (5S) was also studied, suggesting the occurrence of paralogue groups in razor clams, clams, and cockles. In addition, 5S rDNA sequences from 11 species and 7 genus of Mytilidae Raﬁnesque, 1815 mussels were sampled and studied in detail. Four different 5S rDNA types, based on the nontranscribed spacer region were identiﬁed. The phylogenetic analyses performed within each type showed a between-species gene clustering pattern, suggesting ancestral polymorphism. Moreover, some putative pseudogenized 5S copies were also identiﬁed. Our report, together with previous studies that found high degree of intragenomic divergence in bivalve species, suggests that birth-anddeath evolution may be the main force driving the evolution of 5S rDNA in these animals, even at the genus level.},

The species of the P. cuvieri group analyzed by C-banding present a block of heterochromatin in the interstitial region of the short arm of pair 5. Physalaemus cicada Bokermann, 1966 has been considered to be a member of the P. cuvieri species group, although its interspecific phylogenetic relationships remain unknown. The PcP190 satellite DNA has been mapped on the chromosomes of most of the species of the P. cuvieri group. For two species, P. cicada and P. kroyeri (Reinhardt \& Lütken, 1862), however, only the chromosome number and morphology are known. Given this, the objective of the present study was to analyze the chromosomes of P. cicada and P. kroyeri, primarily by C-banding and PcP190 mapping. The results indicate that P. kroyeri and P. cicada have similar karyotypes, which were typical of Physalaemus. In both species, the NORs are located on the long arm of pair 8, and the C-banding indicated that, among other features, P. kroyeri has the interstitial band on chromosome 5, which is however absent in P. cicada. Even so, a number of telomeric bands were observed in P. cicada. The mapping of the PcP190 satellite DNA highlighted areas of the centromeric region of the chromosomes of pair 1 in both species, although in P. kroyeri, heteromorphism was also observed in pair 3. The cytogenetic evidence does not support the inclusion of P. cicada in the P. cuvieri group. In the case of P. kroyeri, the interstitial band on pair 5 is consistent with the existence of a cytogenetic synapomorphy in the P. cuvieri species group.},

The combination of classical cytogenetic techniques along with high quality sequencing is essential to increase the knowledge of the structure and composition of these sequences and, thus, of the structure and function of the whole genome. In this work, the in silico analysis of H1 histone, 5S rDNA, telomeric and Rex repetitive sequences, was compared to their chromosomal mapping by ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), providing a more comprehensive picture of these elements in the turbot genome. FISH assays conﬁrmed the location of H1 in LG8; 5S rDNA in LG4 and LG6; telomeric sequences at the end of all chromosomes whereas Rex elements were dispersed along most chromosomes. The discrepancies found between both approaches could be related to the sequencing methodology applied in this species and also to the resolution limitations of the FISH technique. Turbot cytogenomic analyses have proven to add new chromosomal landmarks in the karyotype of this species, representing a powerful tool to investigate targeted genomic sequences or regions in the genetic and physical maps of this species.},

	abstract = {Background: Pikes represent an important genus (Esox) harbouring a pre-duplication karyotype (2n = 2x = 50) of economically important salmonid pseudopolyploids. Here, we have characterized the 5S ribosomal RNA genes (rDNA) in Esox lucius and its closely related E. cisalpinus using cytogenetic, molecular and genomic approaches. Intragenomic homogeneity and copy number estimation was carried out using Illumina reads. The higher-order structure of rDNA arrays was investigated by the analysis of long PacBio reads. Position of loci on chromosomes was determined by FISH. DNA methylation was analysed by methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.
Results: The 5S rDNA loci occupy exclusively (peri)centromeric regions on 30–38 acrocentric chromosomes in both E. lucius and E. cisalpinus. The large number of loci is accompanied by extreme amplification of genes ({\textgreater}20,000 copies), which is to the best of our knowledge one of the highest copy number of rRNA genes in animals ever reported. Conserved secondary structures of predicted 5S rRNAs indicate that most of the amplified genes are potentially functional. Only few SNPs were found in genic regions indicating their high homogeneity while intergenic spacers were more heterogeneous and several families were identified. Analysis of 10–30 kb-long molecules sequenced by the PacBio technology (containing about 40\% of total 5S rDNA) revealed that the vast majority (96\%) of genes are organised in large several kilobase-long blocks. Dispersed genes or short tandems were less common (4\%). The adjacent 5S blocks were directly linked, separated by intervening DNA and even inverted. The 5S units differing in the intergenic spacers formed both homogeneous and heterogeneous (mixed) blocks indicating variable degree of homogenisation between the loci. Both E. lucius and E. cisalpinus 5S rDNA was heavily methylated at CG dinucleotides.
Conclusions: Extreme amplification of 5S rRNA genes in the Esox genome occurred in the absence of significant pseudogenisation suggesting its recent origin and/or intensive homogenisation processes. The dense methylation of units indicates that powerful epigenetic mechanisms have evolved in this group of fish to silence amplified genes. We discuss how the higher-order repeat structures impact on homogenisation of 5S rDNA in the genome.},

The data are based on in situ hybridisation studies (both radioactive and fluorescent) carried out in major groups of vertebrates (fish, reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals) and invertebrates (mostly insects and mollusks). The database is accessible online at www.animalrdnadatabase.com. The median number of 45S and 5S sites was close to two per diploid chromosome set for both rDNAs despite large variation (1–74 for 5S and 1–54 for 45S sites). No significant correlation between the number of 5S and 45S rDNA loci was observed, suggesting that their distribution and amplification across the chromosomes follow independent evolutionary trajectories. Each group, irrespective of taxonomic classification, contained rDNA sites at any chromosome location. However, the distal and pericentromeric positions were the most prevalent ({\textgreater} 75\% karyotypes) for 45S loci, while the position of 5S loci was more variable. We also examined potential relationships between molecular attributes of rDNA (homogenisation and expression) and cytogenetic parameters such as rDNA positions, chromosome number, and morphology.},

	abstract = {The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region (ITS1, 5.8S rDNA, and ITS2) separates the genes coding for the SSU 18S and the LSU 26S genes in the rDNA units which are organized into long tandem arrays in the overwhelming majority of fungi. As members of a multigenic family, these units are subject of concerted evolution, which homogenizes their sequences. Exceptions have been observed in certain groups of plants and in a few fungal species. In our previous study we described exceptionally high degree of sequence diversity in the D1/D2 domains of two pulcherrimin-producing Metschnikowia (Saccharomycotina) species which appeared to evolve by reticulation. The major goals of this study were the examination of the diversity of the ITS segments and their evolution. We show that the ITS sequences of these species are not homogenized either, differ from each other by up to 38 substitutions and indels which have dramatic effects on the predicted secondary structures of the transcripts. The high intragenomic diversity makes the D1/D2 domains and the ITS spacers unsuitable for barcoding of these species and therefore the taxonomic position of strains previously assigned to them needs revision. By analyzing the genome sequence of the M. fructicola type strain, we also show that the rDNA of this species is fragmented, contains pseudogenes and thus evolves by the birth-and-death mechanism rather than by homogenisation, which is unusual in yeasts. The results of the network analysis of the sequences further indicate that the ITS regions are also involved in reticulation. M. andauensis and M. fructicola can form interspecies hybrids and their hybrids segregate, providing thus possibilities for reticulation of the rDNA repeats.},

	abstract = {Background: For anurans, knowledge of 5S rDNA is scarce. For Engystomops species, chromosomal homeologies are difficult to recognize due to the high level of inter- and intraspecific cytogenetic variation. In an attempt to better compare the karyotypes of the Amazonian species Engystomops freibergi and Engystomops petersi, and to extend the knowledge of 5S rDNA organization in anurans, the 5S rDNA sequences of Amazonian Engystomops species were isolated, characterized, and mapped.
Results: Two types of 5S rDNA, which were readily differentiated by their NTS (non-transcribed spacer) sizes and compositions, were isolated from specimens of E. freibergi from Brazil and E. petersi from two Ecuadorian localities (Puyo and Yasuní). In the E. freibergi karyotypes, the entire type I 5S rDNA repeating unit hybridized to the pericentromeric region of 3p, whereas the entire type II 5S rDNA repeating unit mapped to the distal region of 6q, suggesting a differential localization of these sequences. The type I NTS probe clearly detected the 3p pericentromeric region in the karyotypes of E. freibergi and E. petersi from Puyo and the 5p pericentromeric region in the karyotype of E. petersi from Yasuní, but no distal or interstitial signals were observed. Interestingly, this probe also detected many centromeric regions in the three karyotypes, suggesting the presence of a satellite DNA family derived from 5S rDNA. The type II NTS probe detected only distal 6q regions in the three karyotypes, corroborating the differential distribution of the two types of 5S rDNA.
Conclusions: Because the 5S rDNA types found in Engystomops are related to those of Physalaemus with respect to their nucleotide sequences and chromosomal locations, their origin likely preceded the evolutionary divergence of these genera. In addition, our data indicated homeology between Chromosome 5 in E. petersi from Yasuní and Chromosomes 3 in E. freibergi and E. petersi from Puyo. In addition, the chromosomal location of the type II 5S rDNA corroborates the hypothesis that the Chromosomes 6 of E. petersi and E. freibergi are homeologous despite the great differences observed between the karyotypes of the Yasuní specimens and the others.},

	abstract = {Background: Ribosomal 5S genes are well known for the critical role they play in ribosome folding and functionality. These genes are thought to evolve in a concerted fashion, with high rates of homogenization of gene copies. However, the majority of previous analyses regarding the evolutionary process of rDNA repeats were conducted in invertebrates and plants. Studies have also been conducted on vertebrates, but these analyses were usually restricted to the 18S, 5.8S and 28S rRNA genes. The recent identification of divergent 5S rRNA gene paralogs in the genomes of elasmobranches and teleost fishes indicate that the eukaryotic 5S rRNA gene family has a more complex genomic organization than previously thought. The availability of new sequence data from lower vertebrates such as teleosts and elasmobranches enables an enhanced evolutionary characterization of 5S rDNA among vertebrates.
Results: We identified two variant classes of 5S rDNA sequences in the genomes of Potamotrygonidae stingrays, similar to the genomes of other vertebrates. One class of 5S rRNA genes was shared only by elasmobranches. A broad comparative survey among 100 vertebrate species suggests that the 5S rRNA gene variants in fishes originated from rounds of genome duplication. These variants were then maintained or eliminated by birth-anddeath mechanisms, under intense purifying selection. Clustered multiple copies of 5S rDNA variants could have arisen due to unequal crossing over mechanisms. Simultaneously, the distinct genome clusters were independently homogenized, resulting in the maintenance of clusters of highly similar repeats through concerted evolution.
Conclusions: We believe that 5S rDNA molecular evolution in fish genomes is driven by a mixed mechanism that integrates birth-and-death and concerted evolution.},

The amino acid efﬂux was selective for neutral and anionic amino acids, but excluded cationic amino acids. Acidocalcisomes contained an amino acid pool over four times more concentrated than whole-cell levels, but about 90\% of this was composed of Arg and Lys, so involvement of this pool in amino acid efﬂux was ruled out. Hyposmotic stress induced a rise in intracellular calcium that was dependent on inﬂux of calcium across the plasma membrane, since chelation of extracellular calcium abolished the response. Inﬂux of calcium was conﬁrmed by demonstration of manganese-mediated quenching of intracellular fura-2 ﬂuorescence and partial inhibition of the rise in calcium by calcium channel blockers. Manipulation of intra- and extracellular calcium levels had minor effects on the initial rate of amino acid efﬂux and no effect on the rate of volume recovery.},

However, treatment efﬁcacy is variable, a phenomenon that might be due to host and parasite (e.g., drug resistance) factors. To better understand the possible contribution of parasite factors to this phenomenon, we characterised 12 Leishmania braziliensis (LB) and 25 Leishmania guyanensis (LG) isolates collected from patients experiencing different antimonial treatment outcomes. For each isolate, promastigote cultures were grown in duplicate and were harvested at the late-log and stationary phases of growth. The RNA expression proﬁles of six genes encoding proteins with roles in antimony metabolism (AQP1, MRPA, GSH1, GSH2, TRYR and TDR1) were assessed by means of real-time quantitative PCR. Molecular data were compared to the clinical phenotypes. Within LB, we did not ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant differences in the expression levels of the examined genes among isolates from patients with different treatment outcomes. In LG, GSH1 (encoding gamma-glutamylcysteine synthetase, g-GCS) was overexpressed in therapeutic failure isolates regardless of the growth curve phase. This ﬁnding reveals the predictive potential of promastigote expression curves for the prognosis of cutaneous leishmaniasis caused by LG in Brazil.},

In addition, hyperthermia culture condition enhances genome editing by CRISPR-Cas9 in some cell lines, due to the higher enzyme activity and sgRNA expression level at higher temperature.

              Antimony (Sb) resistance in leishmaniasis chemotherapy has become one of the major challenges to the control of this spreading worldwide public health problem. Since the plasma membrane pore-forming protein aquaglyceroporin 1 (AQP1) is the major route of Sb uptake in
              Leishmania
              , functional studies are relevant to characterize drug transport pathways in the parasite. We generated AQP1-overexpressing

              and
              L. braziliensis

              III
              ) in the presence of silver and nitrate salts. Both AQP1-overexpressing lines presented 3- to 4-fold increased AQP1 expression levels compared with those of their untransfected counterparts, leading to an increased Sb

              susceptibility of about 2-fold. Competition assays using silver nitrate, silver sulfadiazine, or silver acetate prior to Sb

Nevertheless this is of critical importance in gaining an understanding of the complexity of this global threat and in underpinning epidemiological surveillance of pathogen drug resistance in the field. This study aimed to assess the molecular and phenotypic heterogeneity that emerges in natural parasite populations under drug treatment pressure. We studied lines of the protozoan parasite Leishmania (L.) donovani with differential susceptibility to antimonial drugs; the lines being derived from clinical isolates belonging to two distinct genetic populations that circulate in the leishmaniasis endemic region of Nepal. Parasite pathways known to be affected by antimonial drugs were characterised on five experimental levels in the lines of the two populations. Characterisation of DNA sequence, gene expression, protein expression and thiol levels revealed a number of molecular features that mark antimonial-resistant parasites in only one of the two populations studied. A final series of in vitro stress phenotyping experiments confirmed this heterogeneity amongst drug-resistant parasites from the two populations. These data provide evidence that the molecular changes associated with antimonial-resistance in natural Leishmania populations depend on the genetic background of the Leishmania population, which has resulted in a divergent set of resistance markers in the Leishmania populations. This heterogeneity of parasite adaptations provides severe challenges for the control of drug resistance in the field and the design of molecular surveillance tools for widespread applicability.},

There are an estimated 1.5 million new cases each year, with over 90\% occurring in Afghanistan, Algeria, Iran, Iraq, Saudi Arabia, Syria (Old World) and in Brazil and Peru (New World). Miltefosine is effective in vitro and in vivo against Leishmania species and it was demonstrated efficacy in animals via the oral route. This study is the first one for evaluating the effect of miltefosine on cutaneous leishmaniasis of L. major (MRHO/IR/75/ER) by in vivo and in vitro studies in the BALB/c mouse model. As it was shown, miltefosine has a better effect on reduction of size of lesion compared to Glucantime®, also it was not significant by statistical analysis. The results of this study show that miltefosine has a good activity against the proliferation of amastigotes of L. major. The results suggest that oral miltefosine might be a promising approach for developing new anti-Leishmanial drugs.},

These tools use RNA-guided Cas proteins whose large size (950 to 1400 amino acids) has been considered essential to their specific DNA- or RNA-targeting activities. Here we present a set of CRISPR-Cas systems from uncultivated archaea that contain Cas14, a family of exceptionally compact RNA-guided nucleases (400 to 700 amino acids). Despite their small size, Cas14 proteins are capable of targeted single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) cleavage without restrictive sequence requirements. Moreover, target recognition by Cas14 triggers nonspecific cutting of ssDNA molecules, an activity that enables high-fidelity single-nucleotide polymorphism genotyping (Cas14-DETECTR). Metagenomic data show that multiple CRISPR-Cas14 systems evolved independently and suggest a potential evolutionary origin of single-effector CRISPR-based adaptive immunity.},

CRISPR-Cas12a programmed with a CRISPR RNA (crRNA) is used to detect ASFV target DNA. Upon ASFV DNA binding, the Cas12a/crRNA/ASFV DNA complex becomes activated and degrades a fluorescent single stranded DNA (ssDNA) reporter present in the assay. We combine this powerful CRISPR-Cas assay with a fluorescence-based point-of-care (POC) system for rapid and accurate virus detection. Without nucleic acid amplification, a detection limit of 1 pM is achieved within 2 h. In addition, the ternary Cas12a/crRNA/ASFV DNA complex is highly stable at physiological temperature and continues to cleave the ssDNA reporter even after 24 h of incubation, resulting in an improved detection limit of 100 fM. We show that this system is very specific and can differentiate nucleic acid targets with closely matched sequences. The high sensitivity and selectivity of our system enables the detection of ASFV in femtomolar range. Importantly, this system features a disposable cartridge and a sensitive custom designed fluorometer, enabling compact and simple ASFV detection, intended for low resource settings.},

Numerous experimental studies have shown miltefosine is effective on Leishmania donovani, however, effectiveness of miltefosine in treatment of L. infantum is not fully understood. The aims of the present study were to evaluate cytotoxic effects of miltefosine on Iranian strain of L. infantum, and to determine its 50\% inhibitory concentration (IC50) as well as lethal dose.
Methods: Anti-L. infantum activity of miltefosine was studied by treatment of cultured promastigotes with various concentration of miltefosine. MTT assay was used to determine L. infantum viability and the results were expressed as IC50. Annexin-V FLUOS staining was performed to study apoptotic properties of this drug by using FACS flow cytometry.
Results: Miltefosine led to dose-dependent death of L. infantum with features compatible with apoptosis including cell shrinkage, DNA laddering, and externalization of phosphatidylserine with preservation of integrity of plasma membrane. The 100\% effect was achieved at 22 µM and IC50 after 48 hours of incubation was 7 µM.
Conclusion: Miltefosine exerts cytotoxic effect on Iranian strain of L. infantum via an apoptosis-related mechanism.},

This prokaryotic defense system against foreign DNA has been repurposed for genome editing in a broad range of cell tissues and organisms. Trypanosomatids are ﬂagellated protozoa belonging to the order Kinetoplastida. Some of its most representative members cause important human diseases affecting millions of people worldwide, such as Chagas disease, sleeping sickness and different forms of leishmaniases. Trypanosomatid infections represent an enormous burden for public health and there are no effective treatments for most of the diseases they cause. Since the emergence of the CRISPR/Cas9 technology, the genetic manipulation of these parasites has notably improved. As a consequence, genome editing is now playing a key role in the functional study of proteins, in the characterization of metabolic pathways, in the validation of alternative targets for antiparasitic interventions, and in the study of parasite biology and pathogenesis. In this work we review the different strategies that have been used to adapt the CRISPR/Cas9 system to Trypanosoma cruzi, Trypanosoma brucei, and Leishmania spp., as well as the research progress achieved using these approaches.

Structural analysis revealed that TTC5 binds near the ribosome exit tunnel and engages the amino terminus of nascent tubulins. TTC5 mutants incapable of ribosome or nascent tubulin interaction abolished tubulin autoregulation and showed chromosome segregation defects during mitosis.

The last decade new antileishmanials became available, including the oral agent miltefosine. However, in poor endemic countries their wide use was curtailed because of the high costs, and also due to concerns of toxicity and emergence of resistance. Various mechanisms of antileishmanial resistance were identified recently in field isolates. Their elucidation will boost the design of new drugs and the molecular surveillance of resistance. Combination regimens should be evaluated in large trials. Overall, the development of antileishmanials has been generally slow; new drugs are needed.

T. cruzi is considered one of the least studied and most poorly understood tropical disease-causing parasites, in part because of the relative lack of facile genetic engineering tools. This situation has improved recently through the application of clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats–CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR-Cas9) technology, but a number of limitations remain, including the toxicity of continuous Cas9 expression and the long drug marker selection times. In this study, we show that the delivery of ribonucleoprotein (RNP) complexes composed of recombinant Cas9 from Staphylococcus aureus (SaCas9), but not from the more routinely used Streptococcus pyogenes Cas9 (SpCas9), and in vitro-transcribed single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) results in rapid gene edits in T. cruzi and other kinetoplastids at frequencies approaching 100\%. The highly efﬁcient genome editing via SaCas9/sgRNA RNPs was obtained for both reporter and endogenous genes and observed in multiple parasite life cycle stages in various strains of T. cruzi, as well as in T. brucei and Leishmania major. RNP complex delivery was also used to successfully tag proteins at endogenous loci and to assess the biological functions of essential genes. Thus, the use of SaCas9 RNP complexes for gene editing in kinetoplastids provides a simple, rapid, and cloning- and selection-free method to assess gene function in these important human pathogens.},

MMAP directly interacts with MRE11 and is required for optimal stability of the MRN complex during mitosis. MMAP colocalizes with MRN in mitotic spindles, and MMAP-deficient cells display abnormal spindle dynamics and chromosome segregation similar to MRN-deficient cells. Mechanistically, both MMAP and MRE11 are hyperphosphorylated by the mitotic kinase, PLK1; and the phosphorylation is required for assembly of the mMRN complex. The assembled mMRN complex enables PLK1 to interact with and activate the microtubule depolymerase, KIF2A, leading to spindle turnover and chromosome segregation. Our study identifies a mitosis-specific version of the MRN complex that acts in the PLK1–KIF2A signaling cascade to regulate spindle dynamics and chromosome distribution.},
